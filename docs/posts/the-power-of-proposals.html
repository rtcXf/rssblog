        <h1>The power of proposals ✍️</h1>
        <section>
            
            <p>&#128075; Hello!</p><p>Welcome to the very first edition of High Growth Engineering &#8212; I&#8217;m super excited to share this with you.</p><p>Before we start, a quick refresher on why I&#8217;m doing this. The goal of this newsletter is to discuss techniques for <strong>building better software </strong>and <strong>being more effective </strong>in <strong>high growth companies</strong>. I mix in longer form content &#8212; think a short blog post that you could read in 5 minutes &#8212; with some of my favourite links.</p><p>If you subscribe, you&#8217;ll receive weekly posts from me on topics such as:</p><ul><li><p>Techniques for testing in production</p></li><li><p>Estimating the payoff of work</p></li><li><p>How to tame Slack &#128575;</p></li><li><p>Writing maintainable software under time constraints</p></li><li><p>Project management and prioritisation as an engineer</p></li></ul><p>Amongst many more topics. That said &#8212; on with the show!</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/sjwhitworth&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Follow me on Twitter &#128038;&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://twitter.com/sjwhitworth"><span>Follow me on Twitter &#128038;</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h1>The power of proposals</h1><p><em>This section is adapted from an original post on my blog: <a href="https://stephen.sh/posts/proposal-template">A product &amp; engineering proposal template</a></em></p><p>You&#8217;ll hear a common refrain from me on this newsletter. Spending time improving the clarity and quality of your written communication is one of the most impactful activities you can do as a software engineer.</p><p>Want to know an easy way to get paid to practice writing? Write proposals at work.</p><h3>What are proposals?</h3><p>Documents that you write as part of the process of doing work, such as building a new feature. At the highest level, they define a problem, and how you propose to solve it.</p><p>You might also hear them referred to as <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/rfc-process/">RFCs</a>. I prefer the word proposal as the acronym tends to exclude non-technical folks for no good reason.</p><p> </p><h3>Why write them?</h3><p>They're useful for a few different reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Writing your thoughts down is a forcing function for <strong>clear thinking</strong>. You can&#8217;t convince others if you don&#8217;t understand the idea yourself.</p></li><li><p>They amplify the underlying <strong>strength</strong> of the idea. I&#8217;ve never seen a good idea that didn&#8217;t get get stronger after writing a proposal. Weak ideas become self-evident after you&#8217;re forced to explain them to others.</p></li><li><p>They allow other people to give <strong>feedback</strong> to you or your team before you build anything. External feedback helps surface unknown unknowns, and can provide context you don&#8217;t have.</p></li><li><p>They are point-in-time documentation of a system. This is usually better than the default of <strong>no documentation</strong> in fast growing technology companies.</p></li></ul><p></p><h3>When should I write a proposal?</h3><p>A common complaint when asking people is: <em>&#8220;writing proposals takes too much time. It&#8217;ll slow me down from writing code.&#8221;</em> To that I say, <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeWisdom/status/1002181404061552640">weeks of coding can save you hours of planning</a>.</p><p>Write proposals for every non-trivial piece of creative work. A rule of thumb is that I wouldn&#8217;t write a proposal if completing the task would take less than the time it would take you to write a proposal for the work.</p><h3>Who should write proposals?</h3><p>Most commonly, product and engineering teams building software. But in principle, any team undertaking projects.</p><div><hr></div><h2>Writing better proposals</h2><p>OK, that&#8217;s all quite theoretical. At this point, you might be convinced that proposals are good. But, what can you do to write better ones?</p><p></p><h3>Use a proposal template</h3><p>If you do one thing from this newsletter, do this. </p><p>Proposal templates provide a standard structure to a document before the writer fills it out, without being as prescriptive as filling out a form. Using a template has many benefits:</p><ul><li><p>The writer receives helpful prompts on areas they might not have considered &#8212; <em>how does the service fail? How are we going to measure the success of this?</em> This occurs at exactly the time when they should be thinking about these things.</p></li><li><p>Readers can scan similar documents more easily. If particular areas seem light on the ground, they can easily jump to them.</p></li></ul><p><em>But where can I find a proposal template Stephen?, </em>I hear you cry. Don&#8217;t worry. To make life easy for you, I&#8217;ve attached the proposal template that I&#8217;ve used at <a href="https://www.ravelin.com/">Ravelin</a> and <a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>. Feel free to use it for whatever you like: my only ask is that you let me know how you get on with it.

Sprinkle your diagrams with sketches of architectures and flow charts of request lifecycles.</p><h3>Write with confidence</h3><p>Take a stand. Be clear to the reader what your plan is to do, absent any feedback that you receive.</p><h3>Use subheadings for summarising main points</h3><p>Subheadings are great at drawing the reader&#8217;s attention, and providing structure to the document. Take a leaf out of my book: in this section, you get an idea of what to do just by reading the subheadings.</p><h3>Call out tradeoffs</h3><p>All non-trivial software has tradeoffs. Some common ones are listed below:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">Consistency, or availability</a></p></li><li><p>Scale: how much load will this design support?</p></li><li><p>Extensibility: how easily can we extend the software?</p></li><li><p>Speed: how quickly do we need to build this?</p></li><li><p>Lifetime: how long will this software live?</p></li></ul><p>Be clear when a tradeoff exists, and which option you chose. Justify <strong>why</strong> you chose that. There is no correct answer to the above &#8212; only good judgement.</p><h3>Highlight areas for specific focus &#128064;</h3><p>In any proposal, there will be sections you&#8217;re confident in, and sections you&#8217;d like more eyes on. A quick trick to get the useful feedback you need is to specifically call these areas both at the top of the document, and near the specific areas. Something like the following works well:</p><blockquote><p>We&#8217;re confident about the data structures and abstractions mentioned. However, we&#8217;re less up to speed on the failure modes of etcd, and how that impacts correctness of this service. We&#8217;d love specific feedback on how to make the design more resilient to failure.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h1>The best of the internet &#128279;</h1><p>Every week, I collate some of my favourite links to share.

Some highlights:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/1-3Ahy7Fxsc?t=977">16:17</a> - Sending backup requests &#8212; a copy of the same request to a different server &#8212; if you haven&#8217;t received a response in a certain amount of time.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/1-3Ahy7Fxsc?t=1473">24:33</a> - Implementing the techniques discussed means that you can run <a href="https://mapr.com/whitepapers/terasort-benchmark-comparison-yarn/">Terasort</a> on your cluster, and get the same response times if you hadn&#8217;t implemented them. &#129327;</p></li></ul><div id="youtube2-1-3Ahy7Fxsc" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;1-3Ahy7Fxsc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;1426s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1-3Ahy7Fxsc?start=1426s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p></p><h3><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/">Gergely Orosz: The Product-Minded Software Engineer</a> &#128241;</h3><p>This <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/">blog post</a> analyses a type of software engineer that cares deeply about the product they are building.

I empathise heavily with this. Personally, I feel my in person presentation skills are lacking. I get nervous, and I find it hard to speak off the cuff. I&#8217;m far more confident collecting my thoughts, and communicating them through prose.
