        <section>
            
            <p>By now, you have almost certainly heard of the dark web. On sites unlisted by
any search engine, in forums that cannot be accessed without special passwords
or protocols, criminals and terrorists meet to discuss conspiracy theories and
trade child pornography.</p>

<p>We here at VICE headquarters have reported before on the dark web’s <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbxqqy/a-journey-into-the-worst-corners-of-the-dark-web">“hurtcore”

Our coverage of the dark web has been nothing if not comprehensive.</p>

<p>But I wanted to go deeper.
<!--more--></p>

<p>We know that below the surface web is the deep web,
and below the deep web is the dark web. It stands to reason that below the dark
web there should be a deeper, darker web.</p>

<p>A month ago, I set out to find it. Unsure where to start, I made a post on
<em>Reddit</em>, a website frequented primarily by cosplayers and computer
enthusiasts. I asked for a guide, a Styx ferryman to bear me across to the
mythical underworld I sought to visit.</p>

<p>Only minutes after I made my post, I received a private message. “If you want
to see it, I’ll take you there,” wrote <em>Reddit</em> user FingerMyKumquat. “But I’ll
warn you just once—it’s not pretty to see.”</p>

<h2 id="getting-access">Getting Access</h2>
<p>This would not be like visiting Amazon to shop for toilet paper. I could not
just enter an address into the address bar of my browser and hit go. In fact,
as my Charon informed me, where we were going, there are no addresses. At
least, no web addresses.</p>

<p>But where exactly were we going? The answer: Back in time. The deepest layer of
the internet is also the oldest. Down at this deepest layer exists a secret
society of “bulletin board systems,” a network of underground meetinghouses
that in some cases have been in continuous operation since the 1980s—since
before Facebook, before Google, before even stupidvideos.com.</p>

<p>To begin, I needed to download software that could handle the ancient protocols
used to connect to the meetinghouses. I was told that bulletin board systems
today use an obsolete military protocol called Telnet. Once upon a time,
though, they operated over the phone lines. To connect to a system back then
you had to dial its <em>phone number</em>.</p>

<p>The software I needed was called <a href="http://syncterm.bbsdev.net/">SyncTerm</a>. It
was not available on the App Store. In order to install it, I had to compile
it. This is a major barrier to entry, I am told, even to veteran computer
programmers.</p>

<p>When I had finally installed SyncTerm, my guide said he needed to populate my
directory. I asked what that was a euphemism for, but was told it was not a
euphemism. Down this far, there are no search engines, so you can only visit
the bulletin board systems you know how to contact. My directory was the list
of bulletin board systems I would be able to contact. My guide set me up with
just seven, which he said would be more than enough.</p>

<p><em>More than enough for what,</em> I wondered. Was I really prepared to go deeper
than the dark web? Was I ready to look through this window into the black
abyss of the human soul?</p>

<h2 id="heatwave">Heatwave</h2>
<p>I decided first to visit the bulletin board system called “Heatwave,” which I
imagined must be a hangout for global warming survivalists. I “dialed” in. The
next thing I knew, I was being asked if I wanted to create a user account. I
had to be careful to pick an alias that would be inconspicuous in this
sub-basement of the internet. I considered “DonPablo,” and “z3r0day,” but
finally chose “ripper”—a name I could remember because it is also the name of
my great-aunt Meredith’s Shih Tzu. I was then asked where I was dialing from; I
decided “xxx” was the right amount of enigmatic.</p>

<p>And then—I was in. Curtains of fire rolled down my screen and dispersed,
revealing the main menu of the Heatwave bulletin board system.</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/heatwave-main-menu.png" alt=""/>
<em>The main menu of the Heatwave BBS.</em></p>

<p>I had been told that even in the glory days of bulletin board systems, before
the rise of the world wide web, a large system would only have several hundred
users or so. Many systems were more exclusive, and most served only users in a
single telephone area code. But how many users dialed the “Heatwave” today?
There was a main menu option that read “(L)ast Few Callers,” so I hit “L” on my
keyboard.</p>

<p>My screen slowly filled with a large table, listing all of the system’s
“callers” over the last few days. Who were these shadowy outcasts, these expert
hackers, these denizens of the digital demimonde? My eyes scanned down the
list, and what I saw at first confused me: There was a “Dan,” calling from St.
Louis, MO. There was also a “Greg Miller,” calling from Portland, OR. Another
caller claimed he was “George” calling from Campellsburg, KY. Most of the
entries were like that.</p>

<p>It was a joke, of course. A meme, a troll. It was normcore fashion in
noms de guerre. These were thrill-seeking Palo Alto adolescents on Adderall
making fun of the surface web. They weren’t fooling me.</p>

<p>I wanted to know what they talked about with each other. What cryptic
colloquies took place here, so far from public scrutiny? My index finger, with
ever so slight a tremble, hit “M” for “(M)essage Areas.”</p>

<p>Here, I was presented with a choice. I could enter the area reserved for
discussions about “T-99 and Geneve,” which I did not dare do, not knowing what
that could possibly mean. I could also enter the area for discussions about
“Other,” which seemed like a safe place to start.</p>

<p>The system showed me message after message. There was advice about how to
correctly operate a leaf-blower, as well as a protracted debate about the depth
of the Strait of Hormuz relative to the draft of an aircraft carrier. I assumed
the real messages were further on, and indeed I soon spotted what I was looking
for. The user “Kevin” was complaining to other users about the side effects of
a drug called Remicade. This was not a drug I had heard of before. Was it some
powerful new synthetic stimulant? A cocktail of other recreational drugs? Was
it something I could bring with me to impress people at the next VICE holiday
party?</p>

<p>I googled it. Remicade is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s
disease.</p>

<p>In reply to the original message, there was some further discussion about high
resting heart rates and mechanical heart valves. I decided that I had gotten
lost and needed to contact FingerMyKumquat. “Finger,” I messaged him, “What is
this shit I’m looking at here? I want the real stuff. I want blackmail and
beheadings. Show me the scum of the earth!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re ready for the SpookNet,” he wrote back.</p>

<h2 id="spooknet">SpookNet</h2>
<p>Each bulletin board system is an island in the television-static ocean of the
digital world. Each system’s callers are lonely sailors come into port after
many a month plying the seas.</p>

<p>But the bulletin board systems are not entirely disconnected. Faint
phosphorescent filaments stretch between the islands, links in the
special-purpose networks that were constructed—before the widespread
availability of the internet—to propagate messages from one system to another.</p>

<p>One such network is the SpookNet. Not every bulletin board system is connected
to the SpookNet. To get on, I first had to dial “Reality Check.”</p>

<p><img src="https://twobithistory.org/images/reality.png" alt=""/>
<em>The Reality Check BBS.</em></p>

<p>Once I was in, I navigated my way past the main menu and through the SpookNet
gateway. What I saw then was like a catalog index for everything stored in
that secret Pentagon warehouse from the end of the <em>X-Files</em> pilot. There were
message boards dedicated to UFOs, to cryptography, to paranormal studies, and
to “End Times and the Last Days.” There was a board for discussing “Truth,
Polygraphs, and Serums,” and another for discussing “Silencers of Information.”
Here, surely, I would find something worth writing about in an article for
VICE.</p>

<p>I browsed and I browsed. I learned about which UFO documentaries are worth
watching on Netflix. I learned that “paper mill” is a derogatory term used in
the intelligence community (IC) to describe individuals known for constantly
trying to sell “explosive” or “sensitive” documents—as in the sentence,
offered as an example by one SpookNet user, “Damn, here comes that paper mill
Juan again.” I learned that there was an effort afoot to get two-factor
authentication working for bulletin board systems.</p>

<p>“These are just a bunch of normal losers,” I finally messaged my guide. “Mostly
they complain about anti-vaxxers and verses from the Quran. This is just
<em>Reddit</em>!”</p>

<p>“Huh,” he replied. “When you said ‘scum of the earth,’ did you mean something
else?”</p>

<p>I had one last idea. In their heyday, bulletin board systems were infamous for
being where everyone went to download illegal, cracked computer software. An
entire subculture evolved, with gangs of software pirates competing to be the
first to crack a new release. The first gang to crack the new software would
post their “warez” for download along with a custom piece of artwork made using
lo-fi ANSI graphics, which served to identify the crack as their own.</p>

<p>I wondered if there were any old warez to be found on the Reality Check BBS. I
backed out of the SpookNet gateway and keyed my way to the downloads area.
There were many files on offer there, but one in particular caught my
attention: a 5.3 megabyte file just called “GREY.”</p>

<p>I downloaded it. It was a complete PDF copy of E. L. James’ <em>50 Shades of
Grey</em>.</p>
