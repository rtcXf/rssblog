      <p>It is time for a new installment of my beloved PSAs! This time I’ll quickly tell you about a nice new way of keeping track of my writings: <a href="https://twitter.com/veit_blog_bot">a Twitter bot</a>.</p>
<p>Although not a Twitter user myself, I realize that a very small percentage of my users actually uses the RSS feed. A pretty good amount of people who read my blog either come through the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=3f214b4d8605308d27685ebd4548905e">Recurse Centers</a> internal blog aggregator or various postings and links on the web. A small amount of my closest friends even receive pesky private messages on some platform or other so that they&#39;ll feel guilty for not keeping track of my outbursts.</p>
<p>In an effort to create yet another avenue of discoverability, I wrote a few lines to integrate a <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/blog/blob/master/rsser/rsser.py#L12">Twitter bot</a> into my <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/blog/tree/master/rsser">RSS feed generator</a>. It was a tiny amount of work and the fans of social networking among my readers get to follow me in a more convenient way if they so desire, so I declare it a win!</p>
<p>This is all I have for today! Follow my bot on Twitter—or don’t, I’m not a cop.</p>
