      <p>Hey,</p>
<p>If you’ve been working with web servers for a little while, you certainly have already hit the classic “<em>address already in use</em>” (EADDRINUSE).</p>
<p>Here in this article, we go through not only how to see whether such condition as conditioned to happen (by looking at the list of open sockets), but also verify in the actual Kernel code paths where that check happens.</p>

<p>In case you’ve been wondering about how the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html"><code>socket(2)</code></a> syscall works where are these sockets stored, make sure you stick to the end!</p>

<h3 id="what-are-these-sockets-about">What are these sockets about?</h3>
<p>Sockets are the constructs that allow processes on different machines to communicate through an underlying network, being also possibly used as a way of communicating with other processes in the same host (through Unix sockets).</p>
<p>The analogy that really stuck with me is the one presented in the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2DEiNOG"><strong>Computer Networking: A top-down approach</strong></a>.</p>
<p>At a <em>very</em> high-level, we can think of the server machine as this “house” with a set of doors.</p>
<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://ops.tips/blog/-/images/house-sockets-overview.svg" alt="A house that represents a server with a door that represents the socket "/>

    
</figure>

<p>With each door corresponding to a socket, the client can arrive at the door of the house and “knock” at it.</p>
<p>Right after knocking (sending the <code>SYN</code> packet), the house then automatically responds back with a response (<code>SYN+ACK</code>), which is then acknowledged by the house (yep, smart house with a “smart door”).</p>
<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://ops.tips/blog/-/images/client-server-boundary.svg" alt="The interaction between the client and the house when the client is still being greeted by the house "/>

    
</figure>

<p>Meanwhile, while the process just sits there within the house, the clients get organized by the “smart house”, which creates two lines: one for those that the house is still greeting, and another one for those that it finished greeting.</p>
<p>Whenever new clients land in the second line, the process can then let it come in.</p>
<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://ops.tips/blog/-/images/server-accepting.svg" alt="The server process accepting incoming connections from the two queues formed "/>

    
</figure>

<p>Once this connection gets accepted (the client is told to come in), the server is then able to communicate with it, transmitting and receiving data at wish.</p>
<p>One detail to note is that the client doesn’t really “get in” - the server creates a “private door” in the house (a client socket) and then communicates with the client from there.</p>
<p>If you’d like to follow the step by step of implementing a TCP server in C, make sure you check this article! <a href="https://ops.tips/blog/a-tcp-server-in-c/"><strong>Implementing a TCP server</strong></a>.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-look-for-the-list-of-sockets-in-my-system">Where to look for the list of sockets in my system?</h3>
<p>Having the mental model of how the TCP connection establishment looks like, we can now “get into the house” and explore how the machine is creating these “doors” (the sockets), how many doors our house has and in which state they are (are they closed? are they opened?).</p>
<p>For doing so, let’s consider the example of a server that just creates a socket (the door!) and does nothing with it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>// socket.c - creates a socket and then sleeps.

</code></pre></div><p>Under the hood, such simple syscall ends up triggering a whole bunch of internal methods (more on that in the next session) that at some point allows us to seek for information about active sockets under three different files: <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/net/tcp</code>, <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd</code>, and <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/net/sockstat</code>.</p>
<p>While the <code>fd</code> directory presents us a list of files opened by the process, <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/net/tcp</code> file gives us information regarding currently active TCP connections (in their various states) under the process network namespace. <code>sockstat</code>, on the other hand, acts more like a summary.</p>
<p>Starting with the <code>fd</code> directory, we can see that after the <code>socket(2)</code> call we can see the socket file descriptor in the list of file descriptors:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Run socket.out (gcc -Wall -o socket.out socket.c)</span>
<span># and leave it running in the background</span>
./socket.out <span>&amp;</span>
<span>[</span>2<span>]</span> <span>21113</span>
 
<span># Check out that are the open files that the process has.</span>
ls -lah /proc/21113/fd

</code></pre></div><p>Given that from a simple call to <code>socket(2)</code> we don’t have a TCP connection, there’s no relevant information to be gathered from <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/net/tcp</code>.</p>
<p>From the summary (<code>sockstat</code>), we can guess that we’re increasing the number of allocated TCP sockets:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Check the summary regarding socket.</span>
cat /proc/21424/net/sockstat
sockets: used <span>296</span>
TCP: inuse <span>3</span> orphan <span>0</span> tw <span>4</span> alloc <span>106</span> mem <span>1</span>
UDP: inuse <span>1</span> mem <span>0</span>
UDPLITE: inuse <span>0</span>
RAW: inuse <span>0</span>
FRAG: inuse <span>0</span> memory <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To make sure that we’re really increasing the <code>alloc</code> number, we can modify the source code above and allocate 100 sockets instead:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>+ for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
</span><span></span>      int listen_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
      if (err == -1) {
          perror(&#34;socket&#34;);
          return err;
      }
<span>+ }
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now, checking that again, we can see the <code>alloc</code> at a higher number:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">cat /proc/21456/net/sockstat

                   bigger than before!

</code></pre></div><p>Now, the question is - how does the socket gets created under the hood?</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-under-the-hood-when-the-socket-syscall-gets-called">What happens under the hood when the socket syscall gets called?</h3>
<p><code>socket(2)</code> is pretty much a factory that produces the underlying structures for handling operations on such socket.</p>
<p>Making use of <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc"><code>iovisor/bcc</code></a>, we can trace the deepest invocation that happens in the <code>sys_socket</code> call stack and from there understand each step.</p>
<pre><code>|  socket()

</figure>

<p>What that method does is allocate two things: a new <code>inode</code>, and a <code>socket</code> object.</p>
<p>These two are bound together via the <code>sockfs</code> filesystem, which is then responsible for not only keeping track of socket information in the system, but also providing the translation layer between regular filesystem calls (like <code>write(2)</code>) and the network stack (regardless of the underlying communication domain).</p>
<p>By tracing <code>sock_alloc_inode</code>, the method responsible for allocating the inode in <code>sockfs</code>, we’re able to see how that gets set up:</p>

<p>Given that a filesystem inode can be referred from the userspace from a file descriptor, after we have the underlying Kernel structs all set up, <code>sys_socket</code> is then responsible for generating a file descriptor for the user (going through the resource limits validations as presented in <a href="https://ops.tips/blog/proc-pid-limits-under-the-hood/">Process resource limits under the hood</a>.</p>
<p>If you’ve wondered why it is the case that you might receive a “too many open files” error for <code>socket(2)</code>, that’s the reason - it goes through the same resource limits checks:</p>

<p>As you might’ve noticed, there’s no logic in the code related to namespaces when it comes to counting how many sockets where allocated.</p>
<p>That’s something that at first really surprised me given that I thought the networking stack was something that was the most namespaced, but it turns out that there are still some points that are not.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">interesting - `/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/net/tcp` is namespaced, but `/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/net/sockstat` is not (it still isn&#39;t, the patch wasn&#39;t accept) <a href="https://t.co/BcaVCAOczY">pic.twitter.com/BcaVCAOczY</a></p>— Ciro S.

<p>If you’d like to see that by yourself, make sure you follow the article <a href="https://ops.tips/blog/using-network-namespaces-and-bridge-to-isolate-servers/"><strong>Using network namespaces and a virtual switch to isolate servers</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The gist of it is that you can create a bunch of sockets, see <code>sockstat</code>, then create a network namespace, get into it, and then see that although you can’t see the TCP sockets from the whole system over there (namespaces in action!), you can see the total number of allocated sockets in the system (not namespaced).</p>

<p>It’s interesting to see how after exploring the inner workings of the Kernel by just being curious about <code>/proc</code> is leading to answers to why some specific behaviors that I’ve seen in daily operations work in such way.</p>
<p>Given that this is just the first article that is about <code>/proc/net</code> and I’ve already learned a lot, I can’t wait to start digging deeper into the rest of it!</p>
