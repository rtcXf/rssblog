           <p>Simple to learn, endlessly versatile, and perennially in demand by employers paying higher and higher salaries every year ‚Äî it feels like there‚Äôs a million reasons to learn Python.</p>
<p>I mean, what‚Äôs not to love about being a Python programmer?</p>
<p>With a good set of Python skills you can work in data science, machine learning, AI, finance, automation and scripting, web development, game and app development, security, network programming, and so many more attractive and well-paid career fields.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we‚Äôve put together our top reasons why you should learn Python this year. But first, here‚Äôs a quick intro to Python and how it became so popular.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-python">
  <span> What is Python?</span> <a href="#what-is-python">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Python was first developed by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum over the Christmas period in 1989. Seeing he had some spare time over the festive season, he developed Python as a scripting language based on the ABC language. Until recently hailed as the Python ‚Äúbenevolent dictator for life‚Äù, Van Rossum is all but retired now, having since worked for companies like Google, Dropbox, and more recently Microsoft.</p>
<p>Python is a high-level programming language designed to read as easily as possible. Its syntax follows plain English ‚Äî a breath of fresh air compared to less intuitive languages like Java or C++ ‚Äî and it‚Äôs an object-oriented language that can also support functional programming, as well as empirical and structured paradigms.</p>
<p>We also have a <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-functional-programming-python">course on functional programming</a></p>
<p>Python is dynamically and strongly typed, helping detect any errors you‚Äôve made quickly and painlessly. As an interpreted language, Python code can run as soon as you‚Äôve written it ‚Äî so there‚Äôs no delay in getting results, unlike code written in C++ or Java. And, as it‚Äôs open-source, a huge range of frameworks and libraries have been developed on top of Python, for machine learning, AI, and many other uses.</p>
<h2 id="why-learn-python">
  <span> Why Learn Python?</span> <a href="#why-learn-python">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Here are our top 9 reasons why you should learn Python this year:</p>
<h3 id="1-python-is-incredibly-versatile">
  <span> 1. Python is incredibly versatile</span> <a href="#1-python-is-incredibly-versatile">üîó</a></h3>
<p>Python was originally popular back in the 90s for scripting and automation ‚Äî and many Python developers will have read the infamous ‚Äú<a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate The Boring Stuff</a>‚Äù book for Python scripting.</p>
<p>Now in the present day, Python serves so many industries that it would be impossible to name them all here. While it‚Äôs seeing huge growth in popularity in the data science field, it‚Äôs also widely used across marketing, recruitment, web development, AI and machine learning, game development, graphic design, and many more.</p>
<p>Research by <a href="https://www.activestate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ActiveState-Top-10-Python-Use-Cases-Customer-Successes.pdf">ActiveState</a> found some of Python‚Äôs biggest use cases included creating business insights with machine learning in the insurance industry, helping in retail banking with data transformation and manipulation, data mining in the finance industry, and predicting disease prognosis in healthcare.</p>
<p>Not only does it serve so many industries, but it‚Äôs also incredibly versatile in how it works and adapts. You can seamlessly program in Python on Windows, Mac, or Linux, and you can even perform cross-language operations, for example, to call Java or C++ code.</p>
<h3 id="2-python-is-easy-to-learn-and-write">
  <span> 2. Python is easy to learn and write</span> <a href="#2-python-is-easy-to-learn-and-write">üîó</a></h3>
<p>Python is widely considered a very easy language to learn and write. Guido van Rossum focused on making it as simple and lean as possible, getting rid of anything complex, and keeping only what‚Äôs necessary.</p>
<p>This efficiency means that the average Python program can be written in fewer lines of code than almost any other language. Therefore, you can write complete scripts and programs faster and be more productive in Python.</p>
<p>As a result, Python is commonly used for rapid prototyping, especially in engineering startups striving to quickly build an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.</p>
<p>The readability and efficiency make Python one of the easiest languages to learn, especially as a first programming language for beginners. Python‚Äôs ease of use has led it to become a popular language for schools, colleges, and other learning institutions, who use it to teach their students a first programming language. It also features built-in automatic memory management, such as for caching and allocation, so you can focus on your code.</p>
<p><a href="https://wpengine.co.uk/developers-feel-programming-languages/">A WP Engine survey</a> found that developers considered Python the world‚Äôs second easiest-to-learn programming language ‚Äî only more difficult to learn than HTML!</p>
<h3 id="3-enormous-community-and-huge-range-of-libraries-and-frameworks">
  <span> 3. Enormous community and huge range of libraries and frameworks</span> <a href="#3-enormous-community-and-huge-range-of-libraries-and-frameworks">üîó</a></h3>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of being such a popular language is the large community that surrounds it. Beyond just the Python community as a whole, sub-communities discussing and advising on areas like machine learning, AI and web development are an invaluable source of information and inspiration ‚Äî especially when you‚Äôre just getting started and learning the ropes.</p>
<p>Python is the fourth most popular language for coders via a survey on StackOverflow, has an enormous community on GitHub, and there are also over <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups">860,000 people</a> in Python User Groups worldwide.</p>
<p>Python‚Äôs large community has developed a wide range of frameworks and libraries that augment Python‚Äôs already impressive use cases.</p>
<p>Some major libraries and frameworks for different areas include:</p>
