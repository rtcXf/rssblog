<p>Quantum computing may not be coming quite as fast as some in the field had certainly feared (or perhaps hoped). Google did, however, solve an impressive problem this year.</p>
<p>They published a paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5">Nature</a>. It stated that their quantum processor solved a problem that, in contrast, a digital computer would take 10,000 years to solve. The problem that was solved deals with generating certifiably random numbers. Their processor, ‘Sycamore’, uses 53 qubits, which corresponds to a search space of 1016.</p>

<p>Lattice-based Cryptography (LBC) is one of our best bets for secure “Post Quantum Cryptography”. Therefore, almost half of the second round of <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/Round-2-of-the-NIST-PQC-Competition-What-was-NIST/images-media/pqcrypto-may2019-moody.pdf">NIST’s PQC contest</a> is based on lattice math.</p>
<p>Lattice crypto is often based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem">shortest vector problem</a>. A problem where, given a basis of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space">vector space</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)">norm</a>, the goal is to find the shortest non-zero vector.</p>
<p>In addition, Matthew Dozer has a great introductory video:</p>

<p>Instead of the current <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/elliptic-curve-cryptography/">ECDSA</a> implementation, Bitcoin might be switching to <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Schnorr">Schnorr signatures</a> to get more efficiency when signing transactions. Instead of signing each transaction separately, with Schnorr, we can generate a single signature to validate many transactions at once. This allows Bitcoin to scale by requiring less data to be broadcast on the network when grouping transactions.</p>

<p>Also, Nicky Mouha <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1421.pdf">published a paper</a> exposing a vulnerability in Apple’s CoreCrypto Library. This affects 11 out of 12 implemented hashes. However, MD2 is the only function to remain secure. As a result, a new test is founded which can help detect similar problems moving forward.</p>
