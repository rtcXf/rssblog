           <p>Politicians in the United States have been claiming recently that end-to-end encryption is certainly too dangerous to permit. This movement is serious. Congress even <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rUwvwv0X.db8/v0">introduced a bill</a> that would remove the protections that we currently have that allow us to legally encrypt information. Lindsey Graham is one such proponent of this restrictive legislation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator Lindsey Graham, a top Trump ally, is targeting giant internet platforms with a child protection measure that could threaten tech companies‚Äô use of encryption and a liability exemption they prize.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>End-to-end encryption</strong> (<strong>E2EE</strong>) is a system of communication where only the communicating users can read the messages. That is, it prevents potential eavesdroppers.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">Wikipe</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">d</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">ia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every production worthy website uses end-to-end encryption in some sense. The algorithm encrypts the data when it leaves your computer and is decrypted again as it enters the website‚Äôs servers. This ensures, without a doubt, that no malicious third party (which ‚Äúinconveniently‚Äù includes government agencies) can spy on your data.</p>
<p>However, if they have their way, governments and politicians would undoubtedly have a ‚Äúmaster key‚Äù that allows them to decrypt ANY encrypted information. This would be accomplished by forcing security software to <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/encryption-backdoor/">include backdoors</a> to their encryption schemes.</p>
<p>The practical problem is that the math behind encryption is already public knowledge. Criminals will ALWAYS have the ability to encrypt data securely without backdoors, despite what Congress decides. A bill restricting encryption rights would only serve to put everyone‚Äôs personal privacy and security at unnecessary risk.</p>
<h2 id="fear-mongering">
  <span> Fear Mongering</span> <a href="#fear-mongering">üîó</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIf anyone can encrypt and transmit data, criminals will use that technology!‚Äù</p>
<p>- Government People, Probably</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While true, the world can‚Äôt unlearn math. Outlawing companies‚Äô abilities to protect their customer‚Äôs data doesn‚Äôt make illicit <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/what-is-cryptography/">cryptography</a> more difficult.</p>
<p>Obviously, Emotional bills based on irrational fears are rarely a good idea to push quickly through congress. Of course, Politicians typically use these kinds of proposals to create a problem. Then, they can ‚Äúsolve‚Äù it to seem like a hero.</p>
<p>For example, If the argument for a regulation starts with something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of the children</li>
<li>Terrorists will use it</li>
<li>Enables criminals and thugs</li>
<li>Our way of life is being threatened</li>
</ul>
<p>then it probably deserves a thorough examination based on evidence, data, and rationality. Laws that go into effect based on emotional hype historically haven‚Äôt turned out well, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.mass.gov/masslawlib/civil-procedure/witchcraft-law-up-to-the-salem-witchraft-trials-of-1692/">Witchcraft</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Jewish_legislation_in_pre-war_Nazi_Germany">The Jews</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/be-wary-of-emotionally-charged-laws-named-after-dead-people">The Illegals</a></li>
</ul>
