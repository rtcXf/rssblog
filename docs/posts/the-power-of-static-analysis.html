            <p>&#128075; Hello,</p><p>First, I went for my first meal at a restaurant in three and a half months on Sunday. It was really refreshing. You never appreciate what you have until it&#8217;s gone. With the opening of bars and restaurants, life is becoming a little more normal here in London. That said, be safe.</p><p>Second, I apologise for not sending an issue last week. Work has been very busy, and I couldn&#8217;t find the time to put it together. I&#8217;ll do my best to get back on a weekly cadence from here on out. </p><p>Third, if you&#8217;re a first time reader &#8212; hello, good to have you! The goal of this newsletter is to discuss techniques for&nbsp;<strong>building better software&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>being more effective&nbsp;</strong>in&nbsp;<strong>high growth companies</strong>. I mix in longer form content &#8212; think a short blog post that you could read in 5 minutes &#8212; with some of my favourite links.</p><p>Here&#8217;s a couple of my most popular issues if you want to peruse:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://highgrowthengineering.substack.com/p/how-to-scope-work-">How to scope work &#128300;</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://highgrowthengineering.substack.com/p/the-power-of-proposals-">The power of proposals &#9997;&#65039;</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://highgrowthengineering.substack.com/p/writing-maintainable-code-at-speed">Writing maintainable code at speed </a><strong><a href="https://highgrowthengineering.substack.com/p/writing-maintainable-code-at-speed">&#127950;</a></strong></p></li></ul><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/sjwhitworth&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Follow me on Twitter &#128038;&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://twitter.com/sjwhitworth"><span>Follow me on Twitter &#128038;</span></a></p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>The power of static analysis</strong></h1><p>In the <a href="https://highgrowthengineering.substack.com/p/writing-maintainable-code-at-speed">previous issue</a>, I mentioned that I think &#8220;static analysis is the single most underrated tool for maintaining quality at speed&#8221;. I promised to write a whole issue about it <em>soon</em>. Well, readers, I can tell you that <em>soon</em> is now. Please read my love letter to static analysis.</p><h3>Well, what is static analysis?</h3><p><strong>Static analysis</strong> refers to analysing the code of a program, without needing to run it. The goal of static analysis is to find bugs, inconsistencies, design issues and other quirks within your program. This is different from <strong>dynamic analysis</strong> - analysis performed whilst the program is running. Unit testing is an example of dynamic analysis.</p><p>Static analysis tools run over a portion of your codebase, perform analysis, and report back their findings. Here&#8217;s me running <a href="https://staticcheck.io/">Staticcheck</a> on an very old <a href="https://github.com/sjwhitworth/gomondo">repository</a> of mine - back when <a href="https://monzo.com">Monzo</a> was called Mondo! It found multiple issues with respect to unused variables.</p><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png" width="912" height="276" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:276,&quot;width&quot;:912,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:83029,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e6ef3d6-6388-4004-a6e7-989d00f5f1c0_912x276.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><p>Static analysis tools can be configured to your heart&#8217;s desire: including or remove various checks, outputting their results as machine readable formats, -fast modes for quick feedback, and so on. Annotations can be provided in code to tell tools to ignore certain areas or files.</p><h4>Who is static analysis for?</h4><p>Static analysis generally has two audiences:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Engineers</strong>: used to make improvements to the code, and to highlight potential bugs. They do this by hooking into your development workflow, such as an IDE integration, or a pre-commit check.</p></li><li><p><strong>Computers</strong>: often used as part of compiling code. Analysis is done for optimisation purposes, like <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2019/04/12/why-are-unrolled-loops-faster/">unrolling loops</a>.</p></li></ul><p>In this edition, I focus on static analysis designed for human consumption.</p><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>To do their job, static analysis tools must understand the code in a form that is deeper than raw text. To do this, they often transform your code into a representation called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">abstract syntax tree</a>. </p><p>Abstract syntax trees represent your code as a tree of relations. This allows other programs to understand and traverse your code base. For example, you can programatically understand all the functions that a given function is calling, with which arguments. They then perform a variety of checks against this representation, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Naming and formatting</p></li><li><p>Return value analysis, such as returning errors</p></li><li><p>Security vulnerabilities, like SQL injection</p></li><li><p>Assessing for simpler ways to achieve the same result</p></li></ul><h3>Why is it so useful?</h3><h4>It&#8217;s an automated code reviewer</h4><p>Here&#8217;s a quote from the <a href="https://staticcheck.io/">Staticcheck</a> website:</p><blockquote><p>Enrich your team with a reviewer that never sleeps, never tires, and always has a keen eye for code quality!</p></blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a certain class of bugs that are particularly tricky for humans to spot, often get overlooked in code reviews, but are serious errors. In my experience of working with Go, here&#8217;s a few of the following:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/beware-of-copying-mutexes-in-go/">Passing mutexes by value</a>, instead of reference</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CommonMistakes#using-goroutines-on-loop-iterator-variables">Using goroutines with loop iterator variables</a></p></li><li><p>Logging errors but not returning them up the stack</p></li><li><p><a href="https://eleni.blog/2019/06/30/variable-scopes-and-shadowing-in-go/">Shadowing package level variables with local scope</a></p></li></ul><p>Yes, yes, I know your favourite programming language may solve any one of the above issues automatically - that isn&#8217;t the point. These bugs are common, tricky to spot consistently and are often overlooked. These issues are trivial for a static analysis tool to find repeatedly and consistently. This enforces a known lower bar for the quality of the code.</p><h4>Automated enforcer of organisational norms</h4><p><a href="https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756384/obo-9780199756384-0091.xml#:~:text=Norms%20are%20a%20fundamental%20concept,%E2%80%9Cdo%20not%20cheat%E2%80%9D).">Norms</a> are &#8220;rules or expectations that are socially enforced&#8221;. Think of them as conventions: <em>the way we do things around here. </em>Strong norms help you achieve consistency. Consistency creates <em>fungibility</em>: the ability to switch between distinct parts of a code base, with things still feeling very familiar. This matters a lot in high growth companies: engineers tend to move around a lot!</p><p>Static analysis is an important ally in enforcing consistency. It might be as simple as reminding engineers to use <strong>customer_id</strong>, instead of <strong>user_id</strong>.<strong> </strong>It might be enforcing that HTTP handlers are wired up in the same way all over the codebase. It could be preventing your microservices importing any other service&#8217;s package code, apart from the proto files. We have a static analysis tool at Monzo called <strong>svcchecker </strong>that helps us do a little of this. </p><p>Having a tool do this automatically removes the burden of nitpicking from the code reviewer, and ensures a more consistent codebase over time.</p><h4>Can improve maintainability, not just correctness</h4><p>Many existing tools we have focus on correctness: does the system do what we want it to? But there is another dimension &#8212; maintainability: can we change the system easily over time? There&#8217;s a beautiful quote by <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/">Russ Cox</a> that sums up the difference between programming, and software engineering:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Software engineering</strong>&nbsp;is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers.</p></blockquote><p>To me, the central aspect of software engineering is <strong>maintainability</strong>. Whilst writing this piece, it struck me: we don&#8217;t really have many tools that help us understand how maintainable a piece of code is. Most tools in our toolbox focus on correctness. The maintainability of any single piece of code is usually based on human judgement. We&#8217;re still some way from automatically assessing how maintainable a system is, but static analysis can help consistently achieve small improvements here.</p><p>For example, simplicity is highly correlated with maintainability. In Staticcheck, there&#8217;s plenty of checks that help you achieve simpler code:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://staticcheck.io/docs/checks#S1038">Simpler string formatting</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://staticcheck.io/docs/checks#S1017">Simpler string cleaning</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://staticcheck.io/docs/checks#S1001">Using built in copying functions, instead of doing it manually</a></p></li></ul><p>If you aggregate these small gains, you&#8217;ll end up with a far more maintainable codebase.</p><h4>It shortens the feedback loop</h4><p>How long does it take you to know whether what you did was right? Often, the feedback loop in engineering is frustratingly slow. I bet you&#8217;ve all been in the situation where you couldn&#8217;t run the tests locally, so you needed to push to GitHub, wait 5 minutes for CI checks to run, only for the tests to fail. This sucks.</p><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png" width="470" height="435.4008746355685" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1271,&quot;width&quot;:1372,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:470,&quot;bytes&quot;:501784,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d4b24d8-2484-4aa0-bae0-a75a735259ee_1372x1271.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><p>There&#8217;s something joyous about getting instant feedback on the code you just wrote: it allows you to work at the speed of thought. There are non-linear effects at play here: the longer you have to wait for something, the more likely you are to lose your attention and go back to Slack.</p><p>Static analysis tightens this feedback loop, giving you near instant feedback on the code you just wrote. When hooked into your IDE, it&#8217;s fast enough to run on save. This means that you&#8217;re constantly improving based on feedback.</p><h3>Applying this</h3><p>Enough of the abstract. Here&#8217;s some practical tips you can use to start applying static analysis.</p><h4>Find a good tool for the language you use</h4><p>Depending on what language you use, there&#8217;s usually a great static analysis tool available. Here&#8217;s a couple that I&#8217;ve used in the past, or had good recommendations about:</p><ul><li><p>Go: <a href="https://staticcheck.io/">staticcheck</a>, <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/vet/">govet</a></p></li><li><p>Python: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pep8/">pep8</a></p></li><li><p>Ruby: <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop">Rubocop</a></p></li><li><p>Rust: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a></p></li></ul><p>Get these hooked into your IDE!</p><h4>Adding it to continuous integration</h4><p>I&#8217;d recommend adding static analysis as part of your continuous integration check pipeline. Here&#8217;s some tips for rolling it out.</p><p>First, run it only on the files changed in the pull request. As you introduce a tool to an existing code base, you&#8217;re like to find many existing issues. You&#8217;ll annoy your fellow engineers if you flag issues that aren&#8217;t related to changes they made. You can then slowly work through existing issues separate pull requests.</p><p>Second, be deliberate about whether static analysis checks should be advisory, or should fail builds. To start with, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend adding it as a required status check for merging unless you&#8217;re a real purist. Often a big red X on a pull request is enough to prompt the engineer to figure it out themselves. Secondly, there&#8217;s some legitimate edge cases that apply: e.g. generating unused constants from a documentation file that may be used later on. You don&#8217;t want to block engineers in these cases. </p><h4>Developing your own</h4><p>If you don&#8217;t manage to find something you like, you can always roll your own! You can use this to sculpt a tool exactly for your needs. A few examples below:</p><ul><li><p>Enforcing your own naming conventions within your company</p></li><li><p>Forgetting to thread through a context value down the call stack</p></li><li><p>Ensuring that money types are always used for money values, not floats &#128556;</p></li></ul><p>As mentioned earlier, we&#8217;ve done this internally at Monzo, building a tool called <strong>svcchecker</strong>. Let me know if you end up doing this &#8212; I&#8217;d be super interested to find out!</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Best of the internet &#128279;</strong></h1><p>Every week, I collate some of my favourite links to share. Found something cool, or built something great? Send it to me by replying to this email and I might include it in the next edition. &#128231;</p><h4><strong><a href="https://arslan.io/2019/06/13/using-go-analysis-to-write-a-custom-linter/">Using go/analysis to write a custom linter - Fatih Arslan</a></strong></h4><p>Fatih - a stalwart in the Go community - takes us through writing a custom static analysis tool for Go. This is a great place to start if you use Go, and want to hack on some of the ideas discussed in this edition.</p><h4><a href="https://www.perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous">Internet Famous - Patrick McKenzie and David Perell</a></h4><p>This was a great chat, mostly about the power of writing online.</p><h4><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Creative-Selection-Inside-Apples-Process/dp/152900473X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">Creative Selection: Inside Apple's Design Process During the Golden Age of Steve Jobs - Ken Kocienda</a></strong></h4><p>I read this book recently. It&#8217;s a great dive into a golden era at Apple. One of the key stories in the book is about how the iPhone keyboard was designed and developed. It&#8217;s a masterclass in showing how hard it is to achieve simplicity in design &#8212; they went through so many prototypes before they achieved the final product.</p><h4><a href="https://eleni.blog/2020/06/27/abstract-syntax-trees-asts-in-go/">Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in Go - </a><strong><a href="https://eleni.blog/2020/06/27/abstract-syntax-trees-asts-in-go/">Eleni Fragkiadaki</a></strong></h4><p>This is a nice walkthrough of using the AST helper packages in Go.</p><div><hr></div><p>That&#8217;s all from this week&#8217;s High Growth Engineering.
