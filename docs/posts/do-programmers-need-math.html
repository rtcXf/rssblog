            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Dear <a href="http://dpb.bitbucket.org/">David</a>,</p> <p>I&#39;m afraid my off the cuff response the other day wasn&#39;t too well thought out; when you talked about taking calc III and linear algebra, and getting resistance from one of your friends because &#34;wolfram alpha can do all of that now,&#34; my first reaction was horror-- which is why I replied that while I&#39;ve often regretted not taking a class seriously because I&#39;ve later found myself in a situation where I could have put the skills to good use, I&#39;ve never said to myself &#34;<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html">what a waste of time it was to learn that fundamental mathematical concept and use it enough to that I truly understand it</a>.&#34;</p>  <p>But could this be selection bias? It&#39;s easier to recall the math that I use than the math I don&#39;t. To check, let&#39;s look at the nine math classes I took as an undergrad. If I exclude the jobs I&#39;ve had that are obviously math oriented (pure math and CS theory, plus femtosecond optics), and consider only whether I&#39;ve used math skills in non-math-oriented work, here&#39;s what I find: three classes whose material I&#39;ve used daily for months or years on end (Calc I/II, Linear Algebra, and Calc III); three classes that have been invaluable for short bursts (Combinatorics, Error Correcting Codes, and Computational Learning Theory); one course I would have had use for had I retained any of the relevant information when I needed it (Graduate Level Matrix Analysis); one class whose material I&#39;ve only relied on once (Mathematical Economics); and only one class I can&#39;t recall directly applying to any non-math-y work (Real Analysis). Here&#39;s how I ended up using these:</p> <p><strong>Calculus I/II</strong>: critical for dealing with real physical things as well as physically inspired algorithms. Moreover, one of my most effective tricks is substituting a Taylor or Remez series (or some other approximation function) for a complicated function, where the error bounds aren&#39;t too high and great speed is required.</p> <p><strong>Linear Algebra</strong>: although I&#39;ve gone years without, it&#39;s hard to imagine being able to dodge linear algebra for the rest of my career because of <a href="http://walpurgisriot.github.io/blog/2014/01/03/matrix-meditation.html">how general matrices are</a>.</p> <p><strong>Calculus III</strong>: same as Calc I/II.</p> <p><strong>Combinatorics</strong>: useful for impressing people in interviews, if nothing else. Most of my non-interview use of combinatorics comes from seeing simplifications of seemingly complicated problems; combines well with probability and <a href="https://danluu.com/randomize-hn">randomized algorithms</a>.</p> <p><strong>Error Correcting Codes</strong>: there&#39;s no substitute when you need <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error-correcting_code">ECC</a>. More generally, information theory is invaluable.</p> <p><strong>Graduate Level Matrix Analysis</strong>: had a decade long gap between learning this and working on something where the knowledge would be applicable. Still worthwhile, though, for the same reason Linear Algebra is important.</p> <p><strong>Real Analysis</strong>: can&#39;t recall any direct applications, although this material is useful for understanding topology and measure theory.</p> <p><strong>Computational Learning Theory</strong>: useful for making the parts of machine learning people think are scary quite easy, and for providing an intuition for areas of ML that are more alchemy than engineering.</p> <p><strong>Mathematical Economics</strong>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier">Lagrange multipliers</a> have come in handy sometimes, but more for engineering than programming.</p> <p>Seven out of nine. Not bad. So I&#39;m not sure how to reconcile my experience with the common sentiment that, outside of a handful of esoteric areas like computer graphics and machine learning, there is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6949849">no</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=519928">need</a> <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#mathematics">to</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3040286">understand</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=571090">textbook</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1250eg/how_to_crack_the_toughest_coding_interviews_by/c6sb39l">algorithms</a>, let alone more abstract concepts like math.</p> <p>Part of it is selection bias in the jobs I&#39;ve landed; companies that do math-y work are more likely to talk to me. A couple weeks ago, I had a long discussion with a group of our old <a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> friends, who now do a lot of recruiting at career fairs; a couple of them, whose companies don&#39;t operate at the intersection of research and engineering, mentioned that they politely try to end the discussion when they run into someone like me because they know that I won&#39;t take a job with them.</p> <p>But it can&#39;t all be selection bias. I&#39;ve gotten a lot of mileage out of math even in jobs that are not at all mathematical in nature. Even in low-level systems work that&#39;s as far removed from math as you can get, it&#39;s not uncommon to be find a simple combinatorial proof to show that a solution that seems too stupid to be correct is actually optimal, or correct with high probability; even when doing work that&#39;s far outside the realm of numerical methods, it sometimes happens that the bottleneck is a function that can be more quickly computed using some freshman level approximation technique like a Taylor expansion or Newton&#39;s method.</p> <p>Looking back at my career, I&#39;ve gotten more bang for the buck from understanding algorithms and computer architecture than from understanding math, but I really enjoy math and I&#39;m glad that knowing a bit of it has biased my career towards more mathematical jobs, and handed me some mathematical interludes in profoundly non-mathematical jobs.</p> <p>All things considered, my real position is a bit more relaxed than I thought: if you enjoy math, taking more classes for the pure joy of solving problems is worthwhile, but math classes aren&#39;t the best use of your time if your main goal is to transition from an academic career to programming.</p>  <p><a href="http://itmozg.ru/news/1232/">Russian translation available here</a></p>  </div></div>
