           <p>Hope you had a wonderful holiday! I know you might not have been able to take time off, but I hope you were able to spend <em>some</em> time with family and friends. I spent the whole week driving up and down the state of Utah. It was fun, but I’m happy to be back in my office. Kids can be exhausting. Love ’em, but they’re exhausting.</p>
<p>Regards, Lane</p>

<p>We spent a lot of our time this month just making small tweaks to various edge cases that we found cropping up.

<p>by Hussein Nasser</p>
<p>Hussein is the host of the Backend Engineering Podcast! He does a great job tackling deeply technical projects in each episode, usually by himself. HTTP 2 and 3 are fascinating, and there is a lot of confusion around them. Hussein does a great job explaining some of the things you should consider before migrating to HTTP 3.</p>

<p>by Mitchell Hashimoto</p>
<p>Mitchell is a co-founder of one of the companies I admire most: Hashicorp. They make some of the best developer tools out there, including Terraform. He also blogs on his site, and I found this piece about terminal emulators particularly interesting. I’ve been using the terminal for as long as I’ve been a developer, and I had no idea about some of the intricacies he talks about.</p>

  <span> <a href="https://americanexpress.io/choosing-go/">(Article) Choosing Go at American Express [2019]</a></span> <a href="#article-choosing-go-at-american-express-2019httpsamericanexpressiochoosing-go">🔗</a></h3>
<p>In 2019 American Express decided to start using Go for some of their backend services. This article is a great read about why they chose Go and how they went about introducing it to their organization. I love reading about how large companies make decisions like this. It’s a bit older of an article, but I still found it interesting!</p>
