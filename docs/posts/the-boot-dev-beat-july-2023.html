           <p>June was hot. I got sunburned. What else happened… Oh yeah, I finished the new CI/CD course! It’s slated to launch on July 10th, so watch out for that. We also are in the process of hiring a new Boot.dev team member to help us build harder better faster and stronger.</p>
<p>All the best, Lane</p>

  <span> 1. New Logo</span> <a href="#1-new-logo">🔗</a></h3>
<p>We spent some time this month working on a new logo. We wanted something that was more indicative of the fantasy theme of the site, and we’re pumped with the results.</p>

<p>The highest rank in Boot.dev at present is “Archmage” (unlocked at level 100) and the second highest is “Necromancer” (unlocked at level 90).</p>
<p>We purposefully made Archmage practically impossible to reach, but with the new CI/CD course launching next month, I expect we’ll have our first Archmage by the end of July.</p>

<p>I added a few new videos to the Learn Algorithms course, next I want to tackle some of the videos for the Learn Data Structures course! You can find the videos embedded in the course itself, or in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4DtU2_d7hs&amp;list=PLw1W1TeNPmy7ZReuPutxhhrcfHe5yCdsT">YouTube playlist</a>.</p>

<p>When you use a SQL database like Postgres, you have to understand the subtleties of isolation levels from “read committed” to “serializable.” And distributed databases like MongoDB offer a range of consistency levels, from “eventually consistent” to “linearizable” and many options in between. I liked this one, be sure to check it out if you’re interested in expanding your knowledge of databases.</p>

<p>As you might know I’m a VS Code guy, but have always been vim-curious. This was an interesting read because it’s not often you hear someone who has put in the time to learn Vim switch back to VS Code.</p>
