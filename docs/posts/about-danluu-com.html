            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h3 id="about-the-blog">About The Blog</h3> <p>This started out as a way to jot down thoughts on areas that seem interesting but underappreciated. Since then, this site has grown to the point where it gets <a href="https://danluu.com/blog-ads/#update">millions of hits a month</a> and I see that it&#39;s commonly cited by professors in their courses and on stackoverflow.</p> <p>That&#39;s flattering, but more than anything else, I view that as a sign there&#39;s a desperate shortage of <a href="https://danluu.com/teach-debugging/">understandable explanation of technical topics</a>. There&#39;s nothing here that most of my co-workers don&#39;t know (with the exception of maybe three or four posts where I propose novel ideas). It&#39;s just that they don&#39;t blog and I do. I&#39;m not going to try to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs">convince you to start writing a blog</a>, since that has to be something you want to do, but I will point out that there&#39;s a large gap that&#39;s waiting to be filled by your knowledge. When I started writing this blog, I figured almost no one would ever read it; sure Joel Spolsky and Steve Yegge created widely read blogs, but that was back when almost no one was blogging. Now that there are millions of blogs, there&#39;s just no way to start a new blog and get noticed. Turns out that&#39;s not true.</p> <p>This site also archives a few things that have fallen off the internet, like <a href="https://danluu.com/subspace-history/">this history of subspace, the 90s video game</a>, the <a href="https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/physics/">su3su2u1 introduction to physics</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/">the su3su2u1 review of hpmor</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/symbolics-lisp-machines/">Dan Weinreb&#39;s history of Symbolics and Lisp machines</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/open-social-networks/">this discussion of open vs. closed social networks</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/mit-stanford/">this discussion about the differences between SV and Boston, and Stanford and MIT</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/threads-faq/">the comp.programming.threads FAQ</a>, and <a href="https://danluu.com/microsoft-culture/">this presentation about Microsoft culture from 2000</a><a href="https://danluu.com/mcilroy-unix">.</a></p> <p>P.S. If you enjoy this blog, you&#39;d probably enjoy <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=b504af89e87b77920c9b60b2a1f6d5e8">RC</a>, which I&#39;ve heard called &#34;nerd camp for programmers&#34;.</p> </div></div>
