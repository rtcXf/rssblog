           <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol <em>Secure</em> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/https">HTTPS</a> is an extension of the <a href="https://boot.dev/courses/learn-http">HTTP protocol</a>. HTTPS secures the data transfer between client and server by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Encryption">encrypting</a> all of the information communicated.</p>
<p>HTTPS allows a client to safely share sensitive information with a server through an HTTP request. HTTPS is critically important when it comes to sending sensitive data such as credit card information, passwords, or bank account numbers.</p>

<h3 id="too-long-didnt-watch">
  <span> Too long, didn‚Äôt watch</span> <a href="#too-long-didnt-watch">üîó</a></h3>
<p>In short, HTTPS works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client contacts the server and requests a secure connection</li>
<li>The server sends the client its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public key</a></li>
<li>The client and the server use asymmetric encryption (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a>) to negotiate a shared private key</li>
<li>The shared private key is used by the client to encrypt the HTTP request (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm">symmetric encryption</a> like <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/aes-256-cipher/">AES</a>)</li>
<li>The server uses the shared private key to decrypt the HTTP request</li>
<li>The server uses the shared private key to send the client an encrypted response</li>
<li>The client uses the shared private key to decrypt the response</li>
</ol>

<p>HTTPS requires that the client use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSL">SSL</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS">TLS</a> to protect requests and traffic by encrypting the information in the request.</p>
<h2 id="when-should-i-use-https">
  <span> When should I use HTTPs?</span> <a href="#when-should-i-use-https">üîó</a></h2>
<p>While HTTPS is only <em>critically</em> important when it comes to sensitive data, it‚Äôs a good idea to just use HTTPS for <em>all</em> of your web traffic. If you browse a website that doesn‚Äôt use HTTPS, your browser will actually give you an ugly little warning to let you know that the site is not as secure as it should be.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.boot.dev/img/800/no-https.png.webp" alt="no http browser"/></p>
<p><em>If you develop websites, use HTTPS.</em></p>
<h2 id="careful-https-is-not-necessarily-private">
  <span> Careful! HTTPS is not necessarily private</span> <a href="#careful-https-is-not-necessarily-private">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Just because a website uses HTTPS doesn‚Äôt mean that your communication with them is <em>private</em>.</p>
<h3 id="https-keeps-your-messages-private-but-not-your-identity">
  <span> HTTPS keeps your messages private, but not your identity</span> <a href="#https-keeps-your-messages-private-but-not-your-identity">üîó</a></h3>
<p>It‚Äôs important to note that while HTTPS encrypts <em>what you are saying</em>, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily protect <em>who you are</em>. Tools like <a href="https://nordvpn.com/what-is-a-vpn/">VPNs (virtual private networks)</a> are needed for remaining anonymous online.</p>
<p>If you use a VPN, the company that runs the VPN is responsible for keeping your identity private. There is another option for privacy called a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a> network, which is a network of computers that are all connected. The TOR network, which you can use via a Tor browser, is designed to keep your identity <em>anonymous</em>, but it effectively adds another layer of privacy. You can use a VPN <em>and</em> a Tor browser if you‚Äôre really concerned about your privacy.</p>
<p>In short, HTTPS keeps your messages private, but not your identity or the identity of the server you‚Äôre communicating with. VPNs and TOR networks can help with that.</p>
<h3 id="https-ensures-that-youre-talking-to-the-right-person-or-server">
  <span> HTTPS ensures that you‚Äôre talking to the right person (or server)</span> <a href="#https-ensures-that-youre-talking-to-the-right-person-or-server">üîó</a></h3>
<p>In addition to encrypting the information within a request, HTTPS uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signatures</a> to prove that you‚Äôre communicating with the server that you think you are. If a hacker were to intercept an HTTPS request by tapping into a network cable, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to successfully pretend they are your bank‚Äôs web server.</p>
