There are certain things I&#8217;ll forever associate with providing me much-needed comfort during the early part of the pandemic. My Allbirds are one of them. I love those shoes.</p><p>Allbirds recently filed to go public and we&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001653909/000162828021017824/allbirdss-1.htm">now seen its financials</a>. The overall economics are not horrible, but they're not great. The one thing that&#8217;s clear is they are unprofitable and have never been profitable. That was weird to find out, because their CEO talked about how they were profitable (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trendy-sneaker-startup-allbirds-laces-up-1-4-billion-valuation-1539281112">from 2018</a>):</p><blockquote><p>Mr. Zwillinger said an initial public offering was &#8220;not desirable for a variety of reasons&#8221; but that the company had been &#8220;profitable since basically day one.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2021/09/24/profit-claims-by-allbirds-warby-parker-palantir-lyft-before-ipo/">This Forbes piece</a> did a great job covering this phenomenon of the overly "enthusiastic entrepreneurs" that claimed profitability for years until their verified numbers became public:</p><blockquote><p>Along the way, much of the hype went beyond the trendy shoes, centering on Allbirds&#8217; financial success. By CEO Joey Zwillinger&#8217;s account, the company had been &#8220;profitable since basically day one&#8221; &#8212; a remark he made to the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trendy-sneaker-startup-allbirds-laces-up-1-4-billion-valuation-1539281112">Wall Street Journal</a></strong>&nbsp;in 2018. Two years later, he reinforced the message, telling&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/allbirds-ceo-joey-zwillinger-on-the-startups-100-million-round-profitability-and-spac-mania/">TechCrunch</a>, &#8220;We&#8217;ve been profitable for most of our existence.&#8221;</p><p>But when the company filed to go public last month, Zwillinger&#8217;s assertions were at odds with disclosures made by the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In fact, the company stated in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001653909/000162828021017824/allbirdss-1.htm">filing</a>&nbsp;ahead of its planned IPO that it had &#8220;incurred significant net losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.&#8221; AllBirds declined to comment on the record because it is in a quiet period.</p></blockquote><p>The piece cites how the CEOs of Warby Parker, Peloton, and plenty of other companies would all casually drop &#8220;we&#8217;re profitable!&#8221; into interviews. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2021/09/24/profit-claims-by-allbirds-warby-parker-palantir-lyft-before-ipo/">They weren't alone</a>:</p><blockquote><p>More than one in four of the 50 largest venture-backed companies to go public since 2019 made assertions about their profitability that don&#8217;t appear to line up with their later IPO-related disclosures to the SEC, a new&nbsp;__Forbes&nbsp;__analysis has found.</p></blockquote><p>Saying you're profitable when you're not feels dishonest. But if you were a buzzy, private company over the past decade, you had every incentive to stretch the truth. Your investors were likely fine with it because it would garner additional interest. An individual journalist would never shelve a trendy story over an inability to verify that detail. And as Warby Parker has shown the public markets will not only forgive you, they'll reward you with a valuation <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/warby-parker-to-start-trading-on-nyse-11632913202">worthy of a pure software company</a></p><p>After the fact, you can always say &#8220;non-GAAP!&#8221; and &#8220;adjusted!&#8221; and no one could ever really question you. That's how <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2021/09/24/profit-claims-by-allbirds-warby-parker-palantir-lyft-before-ipo/">Peloton justified it</a>: </p><blockquote><p>We were obviously a private company in 2018 and internal company definitions of profitability often differ from [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]. </p></blockquote><p>It's that perfect goalpost-shifting stretch of the truth. As a private company, the only parents in the room were your investors and your board. Maybe constrained access to capital or aggressive journalism might have also acted as parental forces that would provide guidance and discipline, but those limitations haven&#8217;t been there either. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp" width="850" height="567" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:567,&quot;width&quot;:850,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3041fd4e-1b1b-4f9f-930b-8000f670f9f2_850x567.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2><strong>TETHER</strong></h2><p>I'd imagine most Margins' readers have been exposed to the Tether story. I'll try to avoid too much explanation, but basically Tether is a stablecoin that underlies a lot of Bitcoin (and other crypto) trading. A stablecoin is supposed to enable seamless crypto transactions by replacing fiat US dollars, and to do this properly, it should have $1 of real USD backing every $1 of Tether they issue. Tether does not.</p><p>The story has been dripping out <a href="https://twitter.com/ranjanxroy/status/1121550400438534145?s=20">for a few years now</a> but Bloomberg just put out <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">a canonical piece</a> on the mystery of where is the money backing Tether. More than anything, the sheer size of the operation jumped out at me:</p><blockquote><p>Then, this year, Tether Holdings started putting out a huge amount of digital coins. There are now 69 billion Tethers in circulation, 48 billion of them issued this year. That means the company supposedly holds a corresponding $69 billion in real money to back the coins&#8212;an amount that would make it one of the 50 largest banks in the U.S., if it were a U.S. bank and not an unregulated offshore company.</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><p>Elsewhere on the website, there&#8217;s a letter from an accounting firm stating that Tether has the reserves to back its coins, along with a pie chart showing that about $30 billion of its dollar holdings are invested in commercial paper&#8212;short-term loans to corporations. That would make Tether the seventh-largest holder of such debt, right up there with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SCHW:US">Charles Schwab</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/5125Z:US">Vanguard Group</a>.</p></blockquote><p>The story only gets wilder and involves one of the stars from The Mighty Ducks and the guy who co-created the cartoon Inspector Gadget (really!). But the thing that Tether-is-a-fraud-red-pilled me a few months ago was this Deirdre Bosa interview with the Tether GC and CTO:</p><div id="youtube2-ZBEqyiO35cQ" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ZBEqyiO35cQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZBEqyiO35cQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>It's just...so...weird. You have, technically, one of the largest financial institutions in the world, and the General Counsel has a big printed receipt thing (that is I guess a reference to <a href="https://twitter.com/dnivi3/status/1417899571531984899">the Bitcoin Genesis Block</a>), the CTO's internet connection drops, and overall, they're unable to answer the most basic of questions. This hits harder for me having worked at a giant bank for years and seeing how disciplined and careful everyone is about everything. And&#8230;that&#8217;s really not saying much given the behavior of banks in the 2000s.</p><p>But...why not keep doing this? The NY Attorney General <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/tether-bitfinex-reach-settlement-with-new-york-attorney-general.html">had opened a probe but let them settle</a>. Tether's circulation keeps growing, and while they're certainly in the purview of Gary Gensler, there has been zero oversight. Seriously, read the entire Bloomberg piece. It's an amazing narrative, but also a powerful reminder of how the combination of endless risk appetite coupled with a complete lack of oversight means major influential companies can act like moody, rebellious teenagers.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg" width="1135" height="540" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:540,&quot;width&quot;:1135,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50850ea4-7c31-4e9e-bfa4-3067aaee096b_1135x540.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2><strong>PARENTING</strong></h2><p>Having 4 and a 2-year-old makes you think a lot about limits and rules. It's amazing to see just how effective these little humans, whose brains are still forming, are at calling upon some weird quirk of evolution that instructs them to push boundaries just a little bit further every day. Setting rules and disciplining your kids isn't exactly fun. It often feels thankless and it&#8217;s stressful, but it just needs to be done.</p><p>When I was reading about private company profitability proclamations and Tether absurdity, the consistent theme seemed to be a lack of parents in the room. Once upon a time, a board member or an investor might have been the one to caution a founder about exaggerated claims. The public markets might have scolded them for their dishonesty. As <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/about">Matt Stoller might say in his BIG newsletter</a>, the government has forgotten how to govern. All the institutions and economics that once would&#8217;ve forced a company to behave a bit more maturely have been missing.</p><p>These companies are certainly not toddlers. In any other era, given their age and revenue levels, they would've been well into their lives as grown-up public companies with audited financials. They're fairly mature and they're certainly smart. But for so long, no one has imposed any discipline or heavy-handed guidance and we directly see the resultant bad behaviors. We're dealing with teenagers. The DTC companies mentioned above are certainly not too bad. No one reprimanded them for those little lies and they got away with it. Tether...man...that company feels like the parents left the teenager at home alone for a month and gave them a key to the wine cellar and a credit card with no spending limit (<a href="https://www.readmargins.com/p/zirp-explains-the-world">is that part ZIRP</a>?)</p><p>It's not just private companies. As regulators are years behind in trying to figure out what to do with longtime public companies like Facebook, the company's entire PR strategy has become that rare combination of petulance and arrogance unique to a teenager. It&#8217;s that &#8220;I just read the Fountainhead&#8221; and know better than you attitude that I personally know so well - I was a high school policy debater!!! </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9a8a7f07-bd74-4bc9-8fbd-cd4e17de2fa0_1600x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The more I think about all this wackiness and assholery across the economy, it becomes clearer that there have simply been no parents around.
