Additionally, many comments are gratuitously mean. You&#39;ll often hear mean comments backed up with something like &#34;this is better than the other possibility, where everyone just pats each other on the back with comments like &#39;this is great&#39;&#34;, as if being an asshole is some sort of talisman against empty platitudes. I&#39;ve seen people push back against that; when pressed, people often say that it’s either impossible or inefficient to teach someone without being mean, as if telling someone that they&#39;re stupid somehow helps them learn. It&#39;s as if people learned how to explain things by watching Simon Cowell and can&#39;t comprehend the concept of an explanation that isn&#39;t littered with personal insults. Paul Graham has said, &#34;<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5937839">Oh, you should never read Hacker News comments about anything you write</a>”. Most of the negative things you hear about HN comments are true.</p> <p>And yet, I haven’t found a public internet forum with better technical commentary. On topics I&#39;m familiar with, while it&#39;s rare that a thread will have even a single comment that&#39;s well-informed, when those comments appear, they usually float to the top. On other forums, well-informed comments are either non-existent or get buried by reasonable sounding but totally wrong comments when they appear, and they appear even more rarely than on HN.</p> <p>By volume, there are probably more interesting technical “posts” in comments than in links. Well, that depends on what you find interesting, but that’s true for my interests. If I see a low-level optimization comment from nkurz, a comment on business from patio11, a comment on how companies operate by nostrademons, I almost certainly know that I’m going to read an interesting comment. There are maybe 20 to 30 people I can think of who don’t blog much, but write great comments on HN and I doubt I even know of half the people who are writing great comments on HN.</p> <p>I compiled a very abbreviated list of comments I like because comments seem to get lost. If you write a blog post, people will refer it years later, but comments mostly disappear. I think that’s sad -- there’s a lot of great material on HN (and yes, even more not-so-great material).</p> <h4 id="what-s-the-deal-with-ms-word-s-file-format-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-12472505"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12472505">What’s the deal with MS Word’s file format</a>?</h4> <blockquote> <p>Basically, the Word file format is a binary dump of memory. I kid you not. They just took whatever was in memory and wrote it out to disk. We can try to reason why (maybe it was faster, maybe it made the code smaller), but I think the overriding reason is that the original developers didn&#39;t know any better.</p> <p>Later as they tried to add features they had to try to make it backward compatible. This is where a lot of the complexity lies. There are lots of crazy workarounds for things that would be simple if you allowed yourself to redesign the file format. It&#39;s pretty clear that this was mandated by management, because no software developer would put themselves through that hell for no reason.</p> <p>Later they added a fast-save feature (I forget what it is actually called). This appends changes to the file without changing the original file. The way they implemented this was really ingenious, but complicates the file structure a lot.</p> <p>One thing I feel I must point out (I remember posting a huge thing on slashdot when this article was originally posted) is that 2 way file conversion is next to impossible for word processors. That&#39;s because the file formats do not contain enough information to format the document. The most obvious place to see this is pagination. The file format does not say where to paginate a text flow (unless it is explicitly entered by the user). It relies of the formatter to do it. Each word processor formats text completely differently. Word, for example famously paginates footnotes incorrectly. They can&#39;t change it, though, because it will break backwards compatibility. This is one of the only reasons that Word Perfect survives today -- it is the only word processor that paginates legal documents the way the US Department of Justice requires.</p> <p>Just considering the pagination issue, you can see what the problem is. When reading a Word document, you have to paginate it like Word -- only the file format doesn&#39;t tell you what that is. Then if someone modifies the document and you need to resave it, you need to somehow mark that it should be paginated like Word (even though it might now have features that are not in Word). If it was only pagination, you might be able to do it, but practically everything is like that.</p> <p>I recommend reading (a bit of) the XML Word file format for those who are interested. You will see large numbers of flags for things like &#34;Format like Word 95&#34;. The format doesn&#39;t say what that is -- because it&#39;s pretty obvious that the authors of the file format don&#39;t know. It&#39;s lost in a hopeless mess of legacy code and nobody can figure out what it does now.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="fun-with-null-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-12007286"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12007286">Fun with NULL</a></h4> <blockquote> <p>Here&#39;s another example of this fine feature:</p> </blockquote> <pre><code>  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

You don&#39;t design a feature that invites misuse and then use instructions to try to prevent that misuse.</p> <p>There was a derailment in Australia called the Waterfall derailment [1]. It occurred because the driver had a heart attack and was responsible for 7 deaths (a miracle it was so low, honestly). The root cause was the failure of the dead-man&#39;s switch.</p> <p>In the case of Waterfall, the driver had 2 dead-man switches he could use - 1) the throttle handle had to be held against a spring at a small rotation, or 2) a bar on the floor could be depressed. You had to do 1 of these things, the idea being that you prevent wrist or foot cramping by allowing the driver to alternate between the two. Failure to do either triggers an emergency brake.</p> <p>It turns out that this driver was fat enough that when he had a heart attack, his leg was able to depress the pedal enough to hold the emergency system off. Thus, the dead-man&#39;s system never triggered with a whole lot of dead man in the driver&#39;s seat.</p> <p>I can&#39;t quite remember the specifics of the system at Waterfall, but one method to combat this is to require the pedal to be held halfway between released and fully depressed. The idea being that a dead leg would fully depress the pedal so that would trigger a brake, and a fully released pedal would also trigger a brake. I don&#39;t know if they had that system but certainly that&#39;s one approach used in rail.</p> <p>Either way, the problem is equally possible in cars. If you lose consciousness and your foot goes limp, a heavy enough leg will be able to hold the pedal down a bit depending on where it&#39;s positioned relative to the pedal and the leverage it has on the floor.</p> <p>The other major system I&#39;m familiar with for ensuring drivers are alive at the helm is called &#39;vigilance&#39;. The way it works is that periodically, a light starts flashing on the dash and the driver has to acknowledge that. If they do not, a buzzer alarm starts sounding. If they still don&#39;t acknowledge it, the train brakes apply and the driver is assumed incapacitated. Let me tell you some stories of my involvement in it.</p> <p>When we first started, we had a simple vigi system. Every 30 seconds or so (for example), the driver would press a button. Ok cool. Except that then drivers became so hard-wired to pressing the button every 30 seconds that we were having instances of drivers falling asleep/dozing off and still pressing the button right on every 30 seconds because it was so ingrained into them that it was literally a subconscious action.</p> <p>So we introduced random-timing vigilance, where the time varies 30-60 seconds (for example) and you could only acknowledge it within a small period of time once the light started flashing. Again, drivers started falling asleep/semi asleep and would hit it as soon as the alarm buzzed, each and every time.</p> <p>So we introduced random-timing, task-linked vigilance and that finally broke the back of the problem. Now, the driver has to press a button, or turn a knob, or do a number of different activities and they must do that randomly-chosen activity, at a randomly-chosen time, for them to acknowledge their consciousness. It was only at that point that we finally nailed out driver alertness.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12013713">See also</a>.</p> <h4 id="prestige-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-11833832"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11833832">Prestige</a></h4> <blockquote> <p>Curious why he would need to move to a more prestigious position?

We were excited by the Wave vision though we saw the flaws in the product. The Wave team told us about how they wanted our help making wave simpler and more like etherpad, and we thought we could help with that, though in the end we were unsuccessful at making wave simpler. We were scared of Google as a competitor: they had more engineers and more money behind this project, yet they were running it much more like an independent startup than a normal big-company department. The Wave office was in Australia and had almost total autonomy. And finally, after 1.5 years of being on the brink of failure with AppJet, it was tempting to be able to declare our endeavor a success and provide a decent return to all our investors who had risked their money on us.</p> <p>In the end, our decision to join Wave did not work out as we had hoped. The biggest lessons learned were that having more engineers and money behind a project can actually be more harmful than helpful, so we were wrong to be scared of Wave as a competitor for this reason. It seems obvious in hindsight, but at the time it wasn&#39;t. Second, I totally underestimated how hard it would be to iterate on the Wave codebase. I was used to rewriting major portions of software in a single all-nighter. Because of the software development process Wave was using, it was practically impossible to iterate on the product. I should have done more diligence on their specific software engineering processes, but instead I assumed because they seemed to be operating like a startup, that they would be able to iterate like a startup. A lot of the product problems were known to the whole Wave team, but we were crippled by a large complex codebase built on poor technical choices and a cumbersome engineering process that prevented fast iteration.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="the-accuracy-of-tech-news-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-12345365"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12345365">The accuracy of tech news</a></h4> <blockquote> <p>When I&#39;ve had inside information about a story that later breaks in the tech press, I&#39;m always shocked at how differently it&#39;s perceived by readers of the article vs. how I experienced it.

Any discussion was impossible with them. So let me explain a bit...</p> <p>In this case, VLC just uses the Windows APIs (DirectSound), and sends signed integers of 16bits (s16) to the Windows Kernel.</p> <p>VLC allows amplification of the INPUT above the sound that was decoded. This is just like replay gain, broken codecs, badly recorded files or post-amplification and can lead to saturation.</p> <p>But this is exactly the same if you put your mp3 file through Audacity and increase it and play with WMP, or if you put a DirectShow filter that amplifies the volume after your codec output. For example, for a long time, VLC ac3 and mp3 codecs were too low (-6dB) compared to the reference output.</p> <p>At worse, this will reduce the dynamics and saturate a lot, but this is not going to break your hardware.</p> <p>VLC does not (and cannot) modify the OUTPUT volume to destroy the speakers. VLC is a Software using the OFFICIAL platforms APIs.</p> <p>The issue here is that Dell sound cards output power (that can be approached by a factor of the quadratic of the amplitude) that Dell speakers cannot handle. Simply said, the sound card outputs at max 10W, and the speakers only can take 6W in, and neither their BIOS or drivers block this.</p> <p>And as VLC is present on a lot of machines, it&#39;s simple to blame VLC. &#34;Correlation does not mean causation&#34; is something that seems too complex for cheap Dell support…</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="learning-on-the-job-startups-vs-big-companies-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-8278533"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8278533">Learning on the job, startups vs. big companies</a></h4> <blockquote> <p>Working for someone else&#39;s startup, I learned how to quickly cobble solutions together.

I learned a lot of basic technical skills, how to write code quickly and learn new APIs quickly and deploy software to multiple machines. I learned how quickly problems of scaling a development team crop up, and how early you should start investing in automation.</p> <p>Working for Google, I learned how to fix problems once and for all and build that culture into the organization. I learned that even in successful companies, everything is temporary, and that great products are usually built through a lot of hard work by many people rather than great ah-ha insights. I learned how to architect systems for scale, and a lot of practices used for robust, high-availability, frequently-deployed systems. I learned the value of research and of spending a lot of time on a single important problem: many startups take a scattershot approach, trying one weekend hackathon after another and finding nobody wants any of them, while oftentimes there are opportunities that nobody has solved because nobody wants to put in the work. I learned how to work in teams and try to understand what other people want. I learned what problems are really painful for big organizations.

It didn&#39;t. S3 was written by its own team, from scratch. At the time I was at Amazon, working on the retail site, none of Amazon.com was running on AWS. I know, when AWS was announced, with great fanfare, they said &#34;the services that power Amazon.com can now power your business!&#34; or words to that effect. This was a flat out lie.

If you asked me the original question, I&#39;d say the underlying problem is that on Windows all you have is what Microsoft gives you and you can&#39;t typically do better than that. For example, migrating the Chrome build off of Visual Studio would be a large undertaking, large enough that it&#39;s rarely considered.

But for whatever reason on the Linux side some Googlers saw it fit to rewrite the Linux linker to make it twice as fast (this effort predated Chrome), and all Linux developers now get to benefit from that.

And the best advice I have for you is to get out of what you are doing. Really. Even though you state that you are not in a position to do that, you really are. It is okay. You are free. Okay, you are helping your boyfriend&#39;s startup but what is the appropriate cost for this? Would he have you do it if he knew it was crushing your soul?</p> <p>I don&#39;t use the phrase &#34;crushing your soul&#34; lightly. When it happens slowly, as it does in these cases, it is hard to see the scale of what is happening. But this is a very serious situation and if left unchecked it may damage the potential for you to do good work for the rest of your life.</p> <p>The commenters who are warning about burnout are right. Burnout is a very serious situation. If you burn yourself out hard, it will be difficult to be effective at any future job you go to, even if it is ostensibly a wonderful job. Treat burnout like a physical injury. I burned myself out once and it took at least 12 years to regain full productivity. Don&#39;t do it.</p> <ul> <li><p>More broadly, the best and most creative work comes from a root of joy and excitement. If you lose your ability to feel joy and excitement about programming-related things, you&#39;ll be unable to do the best work. That this issue is separate from and parallel to burnout! If you are burned out, you might still be able to feel the joy and excitement briefly at the start of a project/idea, but they will fade quickly as the reality of day-to-day work sets in. Alternatively, if you are not burned out but also do not have a sense of wonder, it is likely you will never get yourself started on the good work.</p></li> <li><p>The earlier in your career it is now, the more important this time is for your development. Programmers learn by doing. If you put yourself into an environment where you are constantly challenged and are working at the top threshold of your ability, then after a few years have gone by, your skills will have increased tremendously. It is like going to intensively learn kung fu for a few years, or going into Navy SEAL training or something. But this isn&#39;t just a one-time constant increase. The faster you get things done, and the more thorough and error-free they are, the more ideas you can execute on, which means you will learn faster in the future too. Over the long term, programming skill is like compound interest. More now means a LOT more later. Less now means a LOT less later.</p></li> </ul> <p>So if you are putting yourself into a position that is not really challenging, that is a bummer day in and day out, and you get things done slowly, you aren&#39;t just having a slow time now. You are bringing down that compound interest curve for the rest of your career. It is a serious problem. If I could go back to my early career I would mercilessly cut out all the shitty jobs I did (and there were many of them).</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="creating-change-when-politically-unpopular-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-5541517"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5541517">Creating change when politically unpopular</a></h4> <blockquote> <p>A small anecdote. An acquaintance related a story of fixing the &#39;drainage&#39; in their back yard. They were trying to grow some plants that were sensitive to excessive moisture, and the plants were dying. Not watering them, watering them a little, didn&#39;t seem to change. They died. A professional gardner suggested that their problem was drainage. So they dug down about 3&#39; (where the soil was very very wet) and tried to build in better drainage. As they were on the side of a hill, water table issues were not considered. It turned out their &#34;problem&#34; was that the water main that fed their house and the houses up the hill, was so pressurized at their property (because it had maintain pressure at the top of the hill too) that the pipe seams were leaking and it was pumping gallons of water into the ground underneath their property. The problem wasn&#39;t their garden, the problem was that the city water supply was poorly designed.</p> <p>While I have never been asked if I was an engineer on the phone, I have experienced similar things to Rachel in meetings and with regard to suggestions. Co-workers will create an internal assessment of your value and then respond based on that assessment. If they have written you off they will ignore you, if you prove their assessment wrong in a public forum they will attack you. These are management issues, and something which was sorely lacking in the stories.</p> <p>If you are the &#34;owner&#34; of a meeting, and someone is trying to be heard and isn&#39;t. It is incumbent on you to let them be heard. By your position power as &#34;the boss&#34; you can naturally interrupt a discussion to collect more data from other members. Its also important to ask questions like &#34;does anyone have any concerns?&#34; to draw out people who have valid input but are too timid to share it.</p> <p>In a highly political environment there are two ways to create change, one is through overt manipulation, which is to collect political power to yourself and then exert it to enact change, and the other is covert manipulation, which is to enact change subtly enough that the political organism doesn&#39;t react. (sometimes called &#34;triggering the antibodies&#34;).</p> <p>The problem with the latter is that if you help make positive change while keeping everyone not pissed off, no one attributes it to you (which is good for the change agent because if they knew the anti-bodies would react, but bad if your manager doesn&#39;t recognize it). I asked my manager what change he wanted to be &#39;true&#39; yet he (or others) had been unsuccessful making true, he gave me one, and 18 months later that change was in place. He didn&#39;t believe that I was the one who had made the change. I suggested he pick a change he wanted to happen and not tell me, then in 18 months we could see if that one happened :-). But he also didn&#39;t understand enough about organizational dynamics to know that making change without having the source of that change point back at you was even possible.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="how-to-get-tech-support-from-google-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-6837249"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6837249">How to get tech support from Google</a></h4> <blockquote> <p>Heavily relying on Google product? ✓</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="taking-funding-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-7462112"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7462112">Taking funding</a></h4> <blockquote> <p>IIRC PayPal was very similar - it was sold for $1.5B, but Max Levchin&#39;s share was only about $30M, and Elon Musk&#39;s was only about $100M.

If you look at the gigantic tech fortunes - Gates, Page/Brin, Omidyar, Bezos, Zuckerburg, Hewlett/Packard - they usually came from having a company that was already profitable or was already well down the hockey-stick user growth curve and had a clear path to monetization by the time they sought investment.

Running a successful pizzeria is more about schlepping to local hotels and leaving them 50 copies of your menu to put at the front desk, hiring drivers who will both deliver pizzas in a timely fashion and not embezzle your (razor-thin) profits while also costing next-to-nothing to employ, maintaining a kitchen in sufficient order to pass your local health inspector&#39;s annual visit (and dealing with 47 different pieces of paper related to that), being able to juggle priorities like &#34;Do I take out a bank loan to build a new brick-oven, which will make the pizza taste better, in the knowledge that this will commit $3,000 of my cash flow every month for the next 3 years, or do I hire an extra cook?&#34;, sourcing ingredients such that they&#39;re available in quantity and quality every day for a fairly consistent price, setting prices such that they&#39;re locally competitive for your chosen clientele but generate a healthy gross margin for the business, understanding why a healthy gross margin really doesn&#39;t imply a healthy net margin and that the rent still needs to get paid, keeping good-enough records such that you know whether your business is dying before you can&#39;t make payroll and such that you can provide a reasonably accurate picture of accounts for the taxation authorities every year, balancing 50% off medium pizza promotions with the desire to not cannibalize the business of your regulars, etc etc, and by the way tomato sauce should be tangy but not sour and cheese should melt with just the faintest whisp of a crust on it.</p> <p>Do you want to write software for a living?

Make your decisions in your own best interest; it is up to the organization to make sure that your interest aligns with theirs.</p> <p>Google used to have a severe problem where code refactoring &amp; maintenance was not rewarded in performance reviews while launches were highly regarded, which led to the effect of everybody trying to launch things as fast as possible and nobody cleaning up the messes left behind. Eventually launches started getting slowed down, Larry started asking &#34;Why can&#39;t we have nice things?&#34;, and everybody responded &#34;Because you&#39;ve been paying us to rack up technical debt.&#34; As a result, teams were formed with the express purpose of code health &amp; maintenance, those teams that were already working on those goals got more visibility, and refactoring contributions started counting for something in perf.

The SWE3 may spend his time writing a bunch of unit tests that catch bugs that wouldn&#39;t really have happened anyway, or migrating from one system to another that isn&#39;t really a large improvement, or going down an architectural dead end that&#39;ll just have to be rewritten later. Jeff or Sanjay (or any of the other folks operating at that level) will spend their time running a proposed API by clients to ensure it meets their needs, or measuring the performance of subsystems so they fully understand their building blocks, or mentally simulating the operation of the system before building it so they rapidly test out alternatives.

If the lack of a reasonable debugging environment costs me even 5% of my productivity, that is too much, because games take so much work to make. At the end of a project, I just don&#39;t have 5% effort left any more. It requires everything. (But the current Linux situation is way more than a 5% productivity drain.

No one is going to actively seek out Skype when so many alternatives exist and are deeply integrated into the products/services they already use.

The bottleneck when I was there were local government regulations, and in fact Kansas City was chosen because it had a unified city/county/utility regulatory authority that was very favorable to Google. To lay fiber to the home, you either need right-of-ways on the utility poles (which are owned by Google&#39;s competitors) or you need permission to dig up streets (which requires a mess of permitting from the city government). In either case, the cable &amp; phone companies were in very tight with local regulators, and so you had hostile gatekeepers whose approval you absolutely needed.</p> <p>The technology was awesome (1G Internet and HDTV!), the software all worked great, and the economics of hiring contractors to lay the fiber itself actually worked out. The big problem was regulatory capture.</p> <p>With Uber &amp; AirBnB&#39;s success in hindsight, I&#39;d say that the way to crack the ISP business is to provide your customers with the tools to break the law en masse. For example, you could imagine an ISP startup that basically says &#34;Here&#39;s a box, a wire, and a map of other customers&#39; locations. Plug into their jack, and if you can convince others to plug into yours, we&#39;ll give you a discount on your monthly bill based on how many you sign up.&#34; But Google in general is not willing to break laws - they&#39;ll go right up to the boundary of what the law allows, but if a regulatory agency says &#34;No, you can&#39;t do that&#34;, they won&#39;t do it rather than fight the agency.</p> <p>Indeed, Fiber is being phased out in favor of Google&#39;s acquisition of WebPass, which does basically exactly that but with wireless instead of fiber. WebPass only requires the building owner&#39;s consent, and leaves the city out of it.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="what-it-s-like-to-talk-at-microsoft-s-teched-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-6100368"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6100368">What it&#39;s like to talk at Microsoft&#39;s TechEd</a></h4> <blockquote> <p>I&#39;ve spoken at TechEds in the US and Europe, and been in the top 10 for attendee feedback twice.</p> <p>I&#39;d never speak at TechEd again, and I told Microsoft the same thing, same reasons.

Let&#39;s go through a few examples in my career:</p> <p>A guy that was the most prolific developer I have ever seen: He&#39;d rewrite entire subsystems over a weekend. The problem is that said susbsytems were not necessarily better than they started, trading bugs for bugs, and anyone that wanted to work on them would have to relearn that programmer&#39;s idiosyncrasies of the week. He easily cost his project 12 man/months of work in 4 months, the length of time it took for management to realize that he had to be let go.</p> <p>A company&#39;s big UI framework was quite broken, and a new developer came in and fixed it. Great, right? Well, he was handed code review veto to changes into the framework, and his standards and his demeanor made people stop contributing after two or three attempts. In practice, the framework died as people found it antiquated, and they decided to build a new one: Well, the same developer was tasked with building new framwork, which was made mandatory for 200+ developers to use. Total contribution was clearly negative.</p> <p>A developer that was very fast, and wrote working code, had been managing a rather large 500K line codebase, and received some developers as help. He didn&#39;t believe in internal documentation or on keeping interfaces stable. He also didn&#39;t believe in writing code that wasn&#39;t brittle, or in unit tests: Code changes from the new developers often broke things, the veteran would come in, fix everything in the middle of the emergency, and look absolutely great, while all the other developers looked to management as if they were incompetent. They were not, however: they were quite successful when moved to other teams. It just happens that the original developer made sure nobody else could touch anything. Eventually, the experiment was retried after the original developer was sent to do other things. It took a few months, but the new replacement team managed to modularize the code, and new people could actually modify the codebase productively.</p> <p>All of those negative value developers could probably be very valuable in very specific conditions, and they&#39;d look just fine in a tough job interview. They were still terrible hires. In my experience, if anything, a harder process that demands people to appear smarter or work faster in an interview have the opposite effect of what I&#39;d want: They end up selecting for people that think less and do more quickly, building debt faster.</p> <p>My favorite developers ever all do badly in your typical stringent Silicon Valley intervew. They work slower, do more thinking, and consider every line of code they write technical debt. They won&#39;t have a million algorithms memorized: They&#39;ll go look at sources more often than not, and will spend a lot of time on tests that might as well be documentation. Very few of those traits are positive in an interview, but I think they are vital in creating good teams, but few select for them at all.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="linux-and-the-demise-of-solaris-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-13081465"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13081465">Linux and the demise of Solaris</a></h4> <blockquote> <p>I worked on Solaris for over a decade, and for a while it was usually a better choice than Linux, especially due to price/performance (which includes how many instances it takes to run a given workload). It was worth fighting for, and I fought hard. But Linux has now become technically better in just about every way. Out-of-box performance, tuned performance, observability tools, reliability (on patched LTS), scheduling, networking (including TCP feature support), driver support, application support, processor support, debuggers, syscall features, etc. Last I checked, ZFS worked better on Solaris than Linux, but it&#39;s an area where Linux has been catching up. I have little hope that Solaris will ever catch up to Linux, and I have even less hope for illumos: Linux now has around 1,000 monthly contributors, whereas illumos has about 15.</p> <p>In addition to technology advantages, Linux has a community and workforce that&#39;s orders of magnitude larger, staff with invested skills (re-education is part of a TCO calculation), companies with invested infrastructure (rewriting automation scripts is also part of TCO), and also much better future employment prospects (a factor than can influence people wanting to work at your company on that OS). Even with my considerable and well-known Solaris expertise, the employment prospects with Solaris are bleak and getting worse every year. With my Linux skills, I can work at awesome companies like Netflix (which I highly recommend), Facebook, Google, SpaceX, etc.</p> <p>Large technology-focused companies, like Netflix, Facebook, and Google, have the expertise and appetite to make a technology-based OS decision. We have dedicated teams for the OS and kernel with deep expertise. On Netflix&#39;s OS team, there are three staff who previously worked at Sun Microsystems and have more Solaris expertise than they do Linux expertise, and I believe you&#39;ll find similar people at Facebook and Google as well. And we are choosing Linux.</p> <p>The choice of an OS includes many factors. If an OS came along that was better, we&#39;d start with a thorough internal investigation, involving microbenchmarks (including an automated suite I wrote), macrobenchmarks (depending on the expected gains), and production testing using canaries. We&#39;d be able to come up with a rough estimate of the cost savings based on price/performance. Most microservices we have run hot in user-level applications (think 99% user time), not the kernel, so it&#39;s difficult to find large gains from the OS or kernel. Gains are more likely to come from off-CPU activities, like task scheduling and TCP congestion, and indirect, like NUMA memory placement: all areas where Linux is leading. It would be very difficult to find a large gain by changing the kernel from Linux to something else. Just based on CPU cycles, the target that should have the most attention is Java, not the OS. But let&#39;s say that somehow we did find an OS with a significant enough gain: we&#39;d then look at the cost to switch, including retraining staff, rewriting automation software, and how quickly we could find help to resolve issues as they came up. Linux is so widely used that there&#39;s a good chance someone else has found an issue, had it fixed in a certain version or documented a workaround.</p> <p>What&#39;s left where Solaris/SmartOS/illumos is better? 1. There&#39;s more marketing of the features and people. Linux develops great technologies and has some highly skilled kernel engineers, but I haven&#39;t seen any serious effort to market these. Why does Linux need to? And 2. Enterprise support. Large enterprise companies where technology is not their focus (eg, a breakfast cereal company) and who want to outsource these decisions to companies like Oracle and IBM. Oracle still has Solaris enterprise support that I believe is very competitive compared to Linux offerings.~</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="why-wasn-t-rethinkdb-more-sucessful-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-12902689"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12902689">Why wasn&#39;t RethinkDB more sucessful</a>?</h4> <blockquote> <p>I&#39;d argue that where RethinkDB fell down is on a step you don&#39;t list, &#34;Understand the context of the problem&#34;, which you&#39;d ideally do before figuring out how many people it&#39;s a problem for.

Her parts of that last call was edited into the radio show so it sounded like she had called and they just figured out the answer on the spot.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="why-are-so-many-people-down-on-blockchain-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-13420777"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13420777">Why are so many people down on blockchain</a>?</h4> <blockquote> <p>Blockchain is the world&#39;s worst database, created entirely to maintain the reputations of venture capital firms who injected hundreds of millions of dollars into a technology whose core defining insight was &#34;You can improve on a Ponzi scam by making it self-organizing and distributed; that gets vastly more distribution, reduces the single point of failure, and makes it censorship-resistant.&#34;</p> <p>That&#39;s more robust than I usually phrase things on HN, but you did ask. In slightly more detail:</p> <p>Databases are wonderful things. We have a number which are actually employed in production, at a variety of institutions. They run the world. Meaningful applications run on top of Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, etc etc.</p> <p>No meaningful applications run on top of &#34;blockchain&#34;, because it is a marketing term. You cannot install blockchain just like you cannot install database. (Database sounds much cooler without the definitive article, too.) If you pick a particular instantiation of a blockchain-style database, it is a horrible, horrible database.</p> <p>Can I pick on Bitcoin? Let me pick on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is claimed to be a global financial network and ready for production right now. Bitcoin cannot sustain 5 transactions per second, worldwide.</p> <p>You might be sensibly interested in Bitcoin governance if, for some reason, you wanted to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a software artifact; it matters to users who makes changes to it and by what process. (Bitcoin is a software artifact, not a protocol, even though the Bitcoin community will tell you differently. There is a single C++ codebase which matters. It is essentially impossible to interoperate with Bitcoin without bugs-and-all replicating that codebase.) Bitcoin governance is captured by approximately ~5 people. This is a robust claim and requires extraordinary evidence.</p> <p>Ordinary evidence would be pointing you, in a handwavy fashion, about the depth of acrimony with regards to raising the block size, which would let Bitcoin scale to the commanding heights of 10 or, nay, 100 transactions per second worldwide.</p> <p>Extraordinary evidence might be pointing you to the time where the entire Bitcoin network was de-facto shut down based on the consensus of N people in an IRC channel. c.f. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9320989">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9320989</a> This was back in 2013. Long story short: a software update went awry so they rolled back global state by a few hours by getting the right two people to agree to it on a Skype call.</p> <p>But let&#39;s get back to discussing that sole technical artifact. Bitcoin has a higher cost-to-value ratio than almost any technology conceivable; the cost to date is the market capitalization of Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin enters through a seigniorage mechanism, every Bitcoin existing was minted as compensation for &#34;security the integrity of the blockchain&#34; (by doing computationally expensive makework).</p> <p>This cost is high. Today, routine maintenance of the Bitcoin network will cost the network approximately $1.5 million. That&#39;s on the order of $3 per write on a maximum committed capacity basis. It will cost another $1.5 million tomorrow, exchange rate depending.</p> <p>(Bitcoin has successfully shifted much of the cost of operating its database to speculators rather than people who actually use Bitcoin for transaction processing. That game of musical chairs has gone on for a while.)</p> <p>Bitcoin has some properties which one does not associate with many databases. One is that write acknowledgments average 5 minutes. Another is that they can stop, non-deterministically, for more than an hour at a time, worldwide, for all users simultaneously. This behavior is by design.</p> </blockquote> <h4 id="how-big-is-the-proprietary-database-market-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-13442042"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13442042">How big is the proprietary database market</a>?</h4> <blockquote> <ol> <li><p>The database market is NOT closed. In fact, we are in a database boom. Since 2009 (the year RethinkDB was founded), there have been over 100 production grade databases released in the market. These span document stores, Key/Value, time series, MPP, relational, in-memory, and the ever increasing &#34;multi model databases.&#34;</p></li> <li><p>Since 2009, over $600 MILLION dollars (publicly announced) has been invested in these database companies (RethinkDB represents 12.2M or about 2%). That&#39;s aside from money invested in the bigger established databases.</p></li> <li><p>Almost all of the companies that have raised funding in this period generate revenue from one of more of the following areas:</p></li> </ol> <p>a) exclusive hosting (meaning AWS et al. do not offer this product) b) multi-node/cluster support c) product enhancements c) enterprise support</p> <p>Looking at each of the above revenue paths as executed by RethinkDB:</p> <p>a) RethinkDB never offered a hosted solution. Compose offered a hosted solution in October of 2014. b) RethinkDB didn&#39;t support true high availability until the 2.1 release in August 2015. It was released as open source and to my knowledge was not monetized. c/d) I&#39;ve heard that an enterprise version of RethinkDB was offered near the end. Enterprise Support is, empirically, a bad approach for a venture backed company. I don&#39;t know that RethinkDB ever took this avenue seriously. Correct me if I am wrong.</p> <p>A model that is not popular among RECENT databases but is popular among traditional databases is a standard licensing model (e.g. Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server). Even these are becoming more rare with the advent of A, but never underestimate the licensing market.</p> <p>Again, this is complete conjecture, but I believe RethinkDB failed for a few reasons:</p> <p>1) not pursuing one of the above revenue models early enough. This has serious affects on the order of the feature enhancements (for instance, the HA released in 2015 could have been released earlier at a premium or to help facilitate a hosted solution).</p> <p>2) incorrect priority of enhancements:</p> <p>2a) general database performance never reached the point it needed to. RethinkDB struggled with both write and read performance well into 2015. There was no clear value add in this area compared to many write or read focused databases released around this time.</p> <p>2b) lack of (proper) High Availability for too long.</p> <p>2c) ReQL was not necessary - most developers use ORMs when interacting with SQL. When you venture into analytical queries, we actually seem to make great effort to provide SQL: look at the number of projects or companies that exist to bring SQL to databases and filesystems that don&#39;t support it (Hive, Pig, Slam Data, etc).</p> <p>2d) push notifications. This has not been demonstrated to be a clear market need yet. There are a small handful of companies that promoting development stacks around this, but no database company is doing the same.</p> <p>2e) lack of focus. What was RethinkDB REALLY good at? It push ReQL and joins at first, but it lacked HA until 2015, struggled with high write or read loads into 2015. It then started to focus on real time notifications. Again, there just aren&#39;t many databases focusing on these areas.</p> <p>My final thought is that RethinkDB didn&#39;t raise enough capital. Perhaps this is because of previous points, but without capital, the above can&#39;t be corrected. RethinkDB actually raised far less money than basically any other venture backed company in this space during this time.</p> <p>Again, I&#39;ve never run a database company so my thoughts are just from an outsider. However, I am the founder of a company that provides database integration products so I monitor this industry like I hawk. I simply don&#39;t agree that the database market has been &#34;captured.&#34;</p> <p>I expect to see even bigger growth in databases in the future. I&#39;m happy to share my thoughts about what types of databases are working and where the market needs solutions. Additionally, companies are increasingly relying on third part cloud services for data they previously captured themselves. Anything from payment processes, order fulfillment, traffic analytics etc is now being handled by someone else.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="a-google-maps-employee-s-opinion-on-the-google-maps-pricing-change-https-news-ycombinator-com-item-id-32403665"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32403665">A Google Maps employee&#39;s opinion on the Google Maps pricing change</a></h3> <blockquote> <p>I was a googler working on Google maps at the time of the API self immolation.</p> <p>There were strong complaints from within about the price changes. Obviously everyone couldn&#39;t believe what was being planned, and there were countless spreadsheets and reports and SQL queries showing how this was going to shit all over a lot of customers that we&#39;d be guaranteed to lose to a competitor.</p> <p>Management didn&#39;t give a shit.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know what the rationale was apart from some vague claim about &#34;charging for value&#34;. A lot of users of the API apparently were basically under the free limits or only spending less than 100 USD on API usage so I can kind of understand the line of thought, but I still.thibk they went way too far.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know what happened to the architects of the plan. I presume promo.</p> <p>Edit: I should add that this was not a knee-jerk thing or some exec just woke up one day with an idea in their dreams. It was a planned change that took many months to plan and prepare for with endless preparations and reporting and so on.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="toc_56">???</h3> <p>How did HN get get the commenter base that it has? If you read HN, on any given week, there are at least as many good, substantial, comments as there are posts. This is different from every other modern public news aggregator I can find out there, and I don’t really know what the ingredients are that make HN successful.</p> <p>For the last couple years (ish?), the moderation regime has been really active in trying to get a good mix of stories on the front page and in tamping down on gratuitously mean comments. But there was a period of years where the moderation could be described as sparse, arbitrary, and capricious, and while there are fewer “bad” comments now, it doesn’t seem like good moderation actually generates more “good” comments.</p> <p>The ranking scheme seems to penalize posts that have a lot of comments on the theory that flamebait topics will draw a lot of comments. That sometimes prematurely buries stories with good discussion, but much more often, it buries stories that draw pointless flamewars. If you just read HN, it’s hard to see the effect, but if you look at forums that use comments as a positive factor in ranking, the difference is dramatic -- those other forums that boost topics with many comments (presumably on theory that vigorous discussion should be highlighted) often have content-free flame wars pinned at the top for long periods of time.</p> <p>Something else that HN does that’s different from most forums is that user flags are weighted very heavily. On reddit, a downvote only cancels out an upvote, which means that flamebait topics that draw a lot of upvotes like “platform X is cancer” “Y is doing some horrible thing” often get pinned to the top of r/programming for a an entire day, since the number of people who don’t want to see that is drowned out by the number of people who upvote outrageous stories. If you read the comments for one of the &#34;X is cancer&#34; posts on r/programming, the top comment will almost inevitably that the post has no content, that the author of the post is a troll who never posts anything with content, and that we&#39;d be better off with less flamebait by the author at the top of r/programming. But the people who will upvote outrage porn outnumber the people who will downvote it, so that kind of stuff dominates aggregators that use raw votes for ranking. Having flamebait drop off the front page quickly is significant, but it doesn’t seem sufficient to explain why there are so many more well-informed comments on HN than on other forums with roughly similar traffic.</p> <p>Maybe the answer is that people come to HN for the same reason people come to Silicon Valley -- despite all the downsides, there’s a relatively large concentration of experts there across a wide variety of CS-related disciplines. If that’s true, and it’s a combination of path dependence on network effects, that’s pretty depressing since that’s not replicable.</p> <p><em>If you liked this curated list of comments, you&#39;ll probably also like <a href="https://danluu.com/programming-books/">this list of books</a> and <a href="https://danluu.com/programming-blogs/">this list of blogs</a>.</em></p> <p><small> This is part of an experiment where I write up thoughts quickly, without proofing or editing. Apologies if this is less clear than a normal post. This is probably going to be the last post like this, for now, since, by quickly writing up a post whenever I have something that can be written up quickly, I&#39;m building up a backlog of post ideas that require re-reading the literature in an area or running experiments.</small></p> <p>P.S. <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu">Please suggest other good comments</a>! By their nature, HN comments are much less discoverable than stories, so there are a lot of great coments that I haven&#39;t seen. </p>  </div></div>
