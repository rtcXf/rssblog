<p>Developer Salary Info 2020</p>
<p>Let’s jump into each role and see what makes them worth their salaries, the <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/jobs/whats-the-job-outlook-for-computer-science-students/">future outlooks</a> for the positions, the average level of experience required for each position, and some of the best ways you can move into one of these careers. Oftentimes a degree is useful for landing these jobs, but it is almost never required, and <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/computer-science/comprehensive-guide-to-learn-computer-science-online/">learning computer science online</a> is a great alternative that can save serious time and money.</p>
<p>The job titles listed here are, for the most part, very different. If you are planning on applying to two or three different kind of jobs, you should also have two or three <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/computer-science/computer-science-resumes/">distinct resumes</a> you use. Each resume can be tailored to the specific job posting.</p>
<h2 id="engineering-manager---152000yr">
  <span> Engineering Manager - $152,000/yr</span> <a href="#engineering-manager---152000yr">🔗</a></h2>
<p>With great responsibility, comes a great salary. I believe Uncle Ben said that. As you can imagine, one way to earn more than the average developer is to manage an entire team of developers. At larger companies, candidates will likely need over ten years of experience to break into management, but at smaller companies, the rules are more flexible, with developers with as few as 5 years able to move into a higher leadership position. With that in mind, smaller companies also often don’t pay quite as well, with compensation often tied directly to the performance of the company as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="responsibilities">

<p>If you haven’t heard of DevOps, you probably need to get your head out of the sand. SREs play a huge role, especially at larger companies. They make sure that a software company’s site and services are always available. Think of the monetary disaster Google would face if their search engine was down for just a single hour. Many millions of dollars would be wasted, and as such, companies like Google are willing to invest heavily in site reliability.</p>

<p>Front-end web developers are responsible for implementing the entire visual and interactive component of a website or web application. Front-end engineers typically interface directly with the APIs, libraries, and data provided by the software written by back-end web developers. While front-end developers used to make quite a bit less than backend developers, that gap is tightening as more and more application logic is pushed to the front-end with frameworks like Vue, React, and Angular moving into the spotlight.</p>
<h3 id="responsibilities-14">
  <span> Responsibilities:</span> <a href="#responsibilities-14">🔗</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Work with designers and establish the needs and preferences of website design</li>
<li>Design, code, and modify websites and web apps</li>

They are typically responsible for the installation of software including email clients, billing systems, customer management software, and password managers. System administrators also actively resolve problems and issues with servers and infrastructure to limit disruptions of work within the organization. Of all the jobs on this list, they require some of the least CS, coding, and math skills.</p>
<h3 id="responsibilities-15">
  <span> Responsibilities:</span> <a href="#responsibilities-15">🔗</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Basically an IT role, not necessarily a developer of software</li>
<li>Design network infrastructure for the internal workings of the company</li>
<li>Manage the organization’s software usage like email and customer management systems</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="developer-qa-or-test---105000yr">
  <span> Developer, QA or Test - $105,000/yr</span> <a href="#developer-qa-or-test---105000yr">🔗</a></h2>
<p>QA engineers design and implement tests and debugging procedures at the companies they work for. QA engineers are often also responsible to track quality assurance metrics (e.g. defect densities and open defect counts) and manage bug tracking software like Jira or GitHub issues. There is a distinct difference between a QA Engineer, and a&#34;normal&#34; QA role, and along with the differences in duties there is a very large pay gap.</p>
<p>A QA engineer will write and deploy code that automates the testing of the software in question. They will write unit tests, integration tests, and help build out a deployment pipeline. On the other hand, non-technical QA positions likely are required to simply act as a user of the software and manually report any issues they find.</p>

<p>Business analysts, also known as BI professionals, work alongside other business analysts and typically report directly to a project manager. Their main tasks include performing detailed requirements analysis, interfacing directly with databases, documenting processes, and performing user acceptance testing.

To do well, a designer needs to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the design tools, as well as design best practices.</p>
