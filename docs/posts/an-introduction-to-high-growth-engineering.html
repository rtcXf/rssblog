        <h1>An introduction to High Growth Engineering</h1>
        <section>
            
            <p>Hello. &#128075;&#127996;</p><p>Building software at high growth companies &#8212; startups mostly &#8212; is a weird experience.</p><p>Things often feel broken. Code quality feels low. But yet, the system works - often very well. Why? Should we be fine with this?</p><p>New engineers are joining constantly. How do you avoid calcifying knowledge within your most tenured engineers, at a disadvantage to new employees?</p><p>Work within these companies is growing ever more popular. But, there&#8217;s a lack of discussion about the art of building software within these environments, and the constraints they provide. I&#8217;d like to fix that.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Who am I, and why am I doing this?</strong></h2><p>My name is&nbsp;<a href="https://stephen.sh/about">Stephen Whitworth</a>. I&#8217;m currently a Senior Software Engineer at Monzo Bank, where I&#8217;m helping fight financial crime. Before that, I co-founded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ravelin.com/">Ravelin</a>: one of the world&#8217;s fastest growing fraud prevention startups.</p><p>I&#8217;ve spent the past 7 years working for high growth companies. My path has followed a &#8216;do-what-needs-to-be-done&#8217; path: software engineering, data science, machine learning, with a little product management thrown in for good measure. I&#8217;ve picked up some useful experience at the intersection of these disciplines, and I&#8217;d love to share it with you.</p><p></p><h2>Why subscribe?</h2><p>As a subscriber, you&#8217;ll learn how to build better software, and operate more effectively in high growth companies. Every week, you&#8217;ll receive an email with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Short, pragmatic posts</strong>&nbsp;that aim to teach&nbsp;<strong>useful techniques</strong>&nbsp;for the following week</p></li><li><p><strong>Interesting links</strong>&nbsp;from around the web with&nbsp;<strong>personal thoughts</strong>&nbsp;on the topics discussed</p></li></ul><p>These are focused on the broad range of skills that it takes to build software effectively at these companies. You can expect discussion on the following topics:</p><ul><li><p>Writing&nbsp;<strong>maintainable</strong>&nbsp;software within constraints</p></li><li><p>Managing projects and&nbsp;<strong>prioritising</strong>&nbsp;effectively</p></li><li><p><strong>Communicating clearly</strong>: both within a team, and outside</p></li><li><p>Improving your&nbsp;<strong>technical writing</strong>&nbsp;skills</p></li></ul><p>However, if I see anything particularly excellent outside of these constraints, I&#8217;ll include it as well. To sign up, just add your email below.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://highgrowthengineering.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://highgrowthengineering.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>If you feel like sharing it with others, I&#8217;d appreciate it!</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://highgrowthengineering.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share High Growth Engineering&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://highgrowthengineering.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share High Growth Engineering</span></a></p><p>Speak soon,</p><p>Stephen</p>
