      <p>Hey,</p>
<p>Some days ago I needed to tweak Docker a little bit to check if changing some parameters of SwarmKit would make it work more reliably.</p>
<p>Given that the value I needed changing was hardcoded, no <code>/etc/docker/daemon.json</code> configuration would do the job. That meant that a fork would be needed.</p>
<p>It turns out that building and running a forked version of Docker is not complicated once you get to know what are the pieces involved.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-the-docker-ce-package-installs-on-my-system">What does the docker-ce package installs on my system?</h3>
<p>As I’ve always been installing docker using <code>apt</code>, the first step was to get it running right from the binaries.</p>
<p>Not knowing what to expect from the building process, I started looking at what are the binaries that the <code>docker-ce</code> package installs on the system.</p>
<p>You can check which binaries are these by looking at <code>dpkg --listfiles &lt;pkg_name&gt;</code> (it lists the files installed to your system from <code>pkg_name</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># List the files that the docker-ce package brought</span>
<span># us and then filter out those that are not in</span>
<span># the `/usr/bin` directory.</span>
sudo dpkg --listfiles docker-ce <span>|</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  grep /usr/bin

/usr/bin
/usr/bin/docker
/usr/bin/docker-containerd
/usr/bin/docker-containerd-ctr
/usr/bin/docker-containerd-shim
/usr/bin/docker-init
/usr/bin/docker-proxy
/usr/bin/docker-runc
/usr/bin/dockerd
</code></pre></div><p>Aside from <code>/usr/bin/docker</code>, which is the Docker CLI, the others are components that are run behind the scenes by the Docker daemon (<code>dockerd</code>).</p>
<p><code>dockerd</code> is the daemon that keeps running as a server, taking commands from your <code>docker</code> client (usually from a unix socket) and then acting upon them, creating containers leveraging the other <code>docker-*</code> binaries.</p>
<h3 id="running-the-docker-daemon-behind-the-scenes">Running the docker daemon behind the scenes</h3>
<p>To have <code>dockerd</code> running at all times, <code>docker-ce</code> (the package) sets two <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/"><code>systemd</code></a> configuration files:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># List the files installed by `docker-ce` and the</span>
<span># filter out those without a systemd in the path.</span>
sudo dpkg --listfiles docker-ce <span>|</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  grep systemd

/lib/systemd
/lib/systemd/system
/lib/systemd/system/docker.service      <span># &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; </span>
/lib/systemd/system/docker.socket       <span># &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>These are <code>systemd</code> units, files that describe resources that should be taken care by <code>systemd</code> - the default <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init">init process</a> used by most distributions (e.g., Ubuntu and Debian).</p>
<p>The later (<code>docker.socket</code>) controls the socket that <code>dockerd</code> uses to listen for requests made by a client.</p>
<p>Given that generally every <code>.socket</code> file must have a corresponding <code>.service</code> unit, the <code>docker.socket</code> is tied to the <code>docker.service</code> unit.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cfg"><span>[Unit]</span>
<span># By telling the unit that it&#39;s part of `docker.service`</span>

<span># This section carries information regarding installation of the unit.</span>
<span># Its sole purpose is to provide `systemd` information regarding `enable`</span>
<span># and `disable` commands issued by `systemctl` during installation or</span>

<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span><span>sockets.target</span>
</code></pre></div><p>ps.: a cool effect of having the <code>.socket</code> unit is that you can keep the socket unit active (thus, having <code>/var/run/docker.sock</code> created) and the docker unit inactive (dockerd not running) at machine startup time such that only when a connection is made to the socket, docker starts.</p>
<p>The former (<code>docker.service</code>) is a service unit that not only executes the <code>dockerd</code> daemon, but it also keeps track of its liveness and makes sure that this is only initialized after some dependencies are met.</p>
<p>It looks like this (with comments added by me):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cfg"><span>[Unit]</span>
<span># Here we specify some of the dependencies that `dockerd` has.</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Having those two files and the binaries, we can get Docker running from a set of binaries.</p>
<p>Let’s now generate them then.</p>
<h3 id="building-right-from-the-docker-ce-repository">Building right from the docker-ce repository</h3>
<p>Although I’m not from Docker Inc, it seems like all the docker packaging for the community edition happens with what’s there in the <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker-ce">docker/docker-ce</a> repository.</p>
<p>Let’s make use of such repository then:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Clone the docker-ce repository to somewhere</span>
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-ce
<span>cd</span> ./docker-ce

<span># Checkout to the tag you want.</span>
<span># ps.: you can gather the list of tags by </span>
<span># running git tag.</span>
git checkout v18.03.1-ce

<span># Having `make` installed, perform the build of </span>
<span># the static binaries.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># This will invoke a series of build steps that</span>
<span># make use of the source code that lives under</span>
<span># the `components` directory.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># ps.: you&#39;re required to have a running `docker`</span>

<span>#</span>
<span># If you&#39;re curious, on a `t2.medium` machine without</span>
<span># any previous runs of this command (i.e, zero cache),</span>
<span># this takes the following `time`:</span>

</code></pre></div><p>That’s it! Send that <code>.tgz</code> to the machines you want, unpack it to the desired destination (<code>/usr/bin</code> if you don’t want to change the systemd scripts) and you’re done.</p>
<p>If all you wanted was a way to build docker from the ground and have the binaries, you can stop here.</p>
<h3 id="modifying-docker-the-daemon-from-the-main-repository">Modifying docker (the daemon) from the main repository</h3>
<p>Because <code>docker-ce</code> is just a repository that gathers three others (<code>docker/docker-ce-packaging</code>, <code>moby/moby</code> and <code>docker/cli</code>), it’s better to keep our modifications under a fork of the real thing (<code>moby/moby</code>) and then (optionally) use a fork of <code>docker-ce</code> to centralize our modifications.</p>
<p>When cloning <code>moby/moby</code> you’ll notice that the process of producing binaries is fairly straightforward: having <code>docker</code> already running, issue <code>make binary</code> and you’ll have a <code>bundles</code> directory filled with the daemon binaries.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># `docker/docker` has been renamed to `moby/moby`, </span>
<span># but given that I want to keep the golang import</span>
<span># paths working, cloning from `docker/docker` makes</span>
<span># things easier.</span>
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker

<span># Set up the git remotes to have my fork&#39;s source</span>
<span># code in.</span>
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/cirocosta/docker
git remote add upstream https://github.com/docker/docker

<span># Grab the code</span>
git fetch --all

<span># Check out to a branch with the modifications</span>
git checkout privileged

<span># Build the binaries</span>
make binary
</code></pre></div><p>Being <code>dockerd</code> made up of several components (like <code>swarmkit</code> and <code>libnetwork</code>), make sure that when you update those, you also update <code>moby/moby</code>’s references (there’s a <code>vendor.conf</code> file there that <a href="https://github.com/LK4D4/vndr">vndr</a> - the vendoring tool - uses to fetch the dependencies). Thankfully, it’s very easy to make use of a fork in <code>vendor.conf</code> - you specify the import path, the git reference of your modified content and then the fork.</p>
<p>For instance, having modified <code>docker/swarmkit</code>, I updated <code>vendor.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>IMPORT PATH                GIT REF       MY FORK
github.com/docker/swarmkit 268f203dda... https://github.com/cirocosta/swarmkit
</code></pre><p>ps.: the same is true for other repositories, like <code>docker/cli</code>.</p>
<p>If all you need is a modified daemon (and not a client), then now you’re done - distribute the binaries and you’re good.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>It looks like the Docker contributors have spent a big time making sure that building Docker is not hard. What bothered me a bit is that it’s quite huge when it comes to dependencies - updating a dependency (using <code>vndr</code>) will end up in fetching a bunch of repositories.</p>
<p>Aside from the dependency complexity (which is understandable), I felt that the process was pretty straightforward - now I get why there are so many contributors.</p>
<p>If you had any question or spotted a mistake, please let me know - I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/cirowrc">cirowrc</a> on Twitter!</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
