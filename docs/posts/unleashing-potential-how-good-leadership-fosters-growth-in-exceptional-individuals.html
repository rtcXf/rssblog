<p>Leadership comes in many styles.  </p>



<p>Some <strong>good</strong>, and some well, let’s just say <strong>not </strong>so good.    </p>



<p>I would like to focus on this topic, by exploring leadership in an open format, and hopefully along the way, help inspire and influence those already in a position of leadership, as well as help shape those future leaders to come.</p>

<p>Now, let’s get started.</p>



<h2>What is Leadership?</h2>



<p>Let me begin by asking you the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>What thoughts come to mind when you hear the word <strong>leadership</strong>?</li>



<li>Is it a term you <strong>respect</strong>, <strong>aspire</strong> to be, or have <strong>problems</strong> with?</li>
</ul>



<p>The definition below is how I imagine most people think about <strong>leadership</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You refer to people who are in control of a group or organisation as the <strong>leadership</strong>.</p>
<cite>As defined in the <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/leadership">Collin’s Dictionary</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>The issue I have with the above definition is the word <strong>control</strong>.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Control</strong> <strong>of</strong> an organisation, place, or system is the power to make all the important decisions about the way that it is run.</p>



<p>OR</p>



<p>If you have <strong>control</strong> of something or someone, you are able to make them do what you want them to do.</p>
<cite>As defined in the <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/control">Collin’s Dictionary</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The definitions above invoke a negative connotation, and are not good practises of leadership, they have been creating challenges for quite some time.</p>



<p>I believe the definition below is a much better definition</p>



<ul>
<li>It’s a suitable way to understand <strong>leadership</strong></li>



<li>It is more <strong>qualities/actions</strong> focused rather than <strong>control/manipulation</strong> focused</li>



<li>They can be effectively <strong>measured</strong>.</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Leadership</strong> refers to the qualities that make someone a good leader, or the methods a leader uses to do his or her job.</p>
<cite>As defined in the <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/leadership">Collin’s Dictionary</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Now let’s further explore these qualities.</p>



<h2>What are the different qualities?</h2>

<p>What do you think about the <strong>leadership</strong> surrounding you? do those leaders:</p>



<ul>
<li>Inspire / Encourage / Grow / Invest in / Respect / Trust you?</li>
</ul>



<h2>What are different Leadership styles?</h2>



<p>Here are leadership styles that create and promote good qualities.</p>



<p>Alignment can be more than to just one, however your likely to find a strong alignment to one while having a softer alignment to multiple.</p>



<h3>Servant Leadership</h3>



<p>Servant leadership occurs <strong>when the leader’s main goal and responsibility is to provide service to their people</strong>. A servant leader focuses on the people that are directly below them, rather than the company as a whole.</p>



<h3>Strategic leadership</h3>



<p>Strategic leadership is a <strong>leader’s ability to visualize, plan, lead</strong>, and make the best out of the resources they have to execute strategies efficiently and successfully.  They marry their strategic plan to their strategic management.</p>



<h3>Affiliative leadership</h3>



<p>An affiliative style of leadership puts people first, concentrating on <strong>creating a harmonious working environment and building emotional bonds</strong>. The affiliative leadership style requires lots of empathy and the ability to build relationships through a range of communication styles.</p>



<h3>Coaching leadership</h3>



<p>Coaching leadership can be <strong>characterized by collaboration, support, and guidance</strong>. They are focused on bringing out the best in their teams by guiding them through goals and obstacles. This leadership style is very much opposite to autocratic leadership, which is focused on top-down decision making.</p>



<h3>Bureaucratic leadership</h3>



<p>Bureaucratic leadership is <strong>a common form of management in which leadership is based upon fixed official duties and adherence to a system of rules</strong>. … Leaders are subject to a system of behavioral and technical rules that define the scope of their authority, dictate certain actions and constrain certain actions.</p>



<h3>Cross-cultural leadership</h3>



<p>The act of guiding, supporting, motivating, and shaping the way people think globally is called cross-cultural leadership.</p>



<h3>What style are you aligned to?</h3>



<p><strong>Servant</strong> <strong>leadership</strong> is my favourite style.  Where I find myself least drawn to is Bureaucratic leadership.</p>



<p>Servant Leadership is what I am particularly passionate about, and what I have aspired to grow into over the years.  While seeking and growing my understand and capabilities in other leadership styles, in particular Strategic and Coaching.</p>



<h2>How can you measure Leadership? </h2>



<p>There are many well written articles that discuss the benefits of measuring leadership. </p>



<p>Here are some links to articles that articulate benefits as well as some strategies for measuring.</p>

</ul>



<p>Some of the <strong>best</strong> leadership I have experienced, understood the importance of measuring themselves, and activity took it upon themselves to gather accurate outcomes.</p>



<h3>Let’s explore some of these measures</h3>



<h4>Engagement</h4>



<ul>
<li>How supportive are those around you to the vision/mission you are trying to achieve together, and do those around you understand what you are trying to achieve together?</li>



<li>Do you spend time with those around you, not just other leaders?</li>



<li>How do you treat others, and how do others treat you?</li>



<li>Are you supporting those around you, and do those around you feel supported?</li>



<li>Do you coach/train/invest in those around you?</li>



<li>Are you producing good leaders?</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://decision-wise.com/infographic-5-personal-benefits-of-employee-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Personal Benefits of Employee Engagement </a>– Decision Wise</p>



<p>These are all questions you need to ask yourself on a regular basis.</p>



<ul>
<li>Engagement is personal more than professional.</li>
</ul>



<p>Lack of engagement is a measure you can gather through sources such as surveys, but for it to be effective you <strong>must</strong> have and demonstrate leadership qualities, otherwise you won’t receive honest and accurate results.</p>



<h4>Growth</h4>



<ul>
<li>Is your area showing employee growth, or are those around you leaving?</li>



<li>Are people being promoted?</li>



<li>How are people’s attitudes, are they passionate?</li>



<li>Do people feel invested in, are you growing people helping them to achieve their goals, along the journey?</li>
</ul>



<p>Helping people achieve their goals is very important, I have been fortunate to be able to coaching team members, while ensuring that their career goals are addressed, this has included supporting people restart their careers as well as change their careers and grow in their current career. </p>



<p>Team building is something that I value and strongly believe in.  </p>



<p>When recruiting it is important to build a team with foundation built on good culture and attitude.  Technical capability is important but should not be the focus, when building up a team look for team members that are positive and willing to learn, have a can-do attitude and are flexible and you want to grow and invest in.</p>



<h4>Feedback</h4>



<ul>
<li>Do you action feedback?</li>



<li>How is the customer experience?</li>



<li>How are your employees moral?</li>
</ul>



<p><meta charset="utf-8"/>Trust, Integrity and Honesty is crucial in order to gather feedback through sources such as 1:1’s, and you <strong>must</strong> have and demonstrate leadership qualities.  Once you have gathered the feedback it is important to them demonstrate how you are going to address it and follow through, doing so will grow your customer experience, employees moral and overall health of the people you work with.</p>

<p>I encourage you to read through this with an open mind, and if you identify with any of these, to see them as learning opportunities. </p>

<h2>Are you up to the challenge?</h2>



<p>Do you remember what your experience was like throughout your career?  </p>



<p>I am sure it involved proving your value and worth on many occasions, to build up reputation and relationships.  </p>



<p>Do you remember how hard it was to build up those relationships?  </p>



<p>You will often hear, your career is your responsibility, but in my opinion it shouldn’t just have to be yours alone, there are influences that you cannot control and having sponsorship and support is vital.</p>



<p>Now, imagine if those people in leadership positions, genuinely cared and they:</p>



<ul>
<li>Approached you via a 1:1, not just scheduled regular sessions.</li>



<li>Acknowledged your successes and learnings through failures, they had observed.</li>



<li>Took the time to understand your career progression.</li>



<li>Believed in your capability based on facts about your current role or past experiences. </li>



<li>Understood where you needed to develop and grow.</li>



<li>Informed you they will invest time in you, providing you real experience, and grow you.</li>
</ul>



<h3>My challenge for you is to be that leader!</h3>



<ul>
<li>Identify a person you work with or have in your team.</li>



<li>Examine their successes and learnings through failures.</li>



<li>Understand their career progression.</li>



<li>Set a roadmap and timeframe with that person.</li>



<li>Allow them to undertake tasks providing them with real experience </li>



<li>Allow them to dedicate time each week to undertake those tasks</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, ensure you follow through, either</p>



<ul>
<li>Give them a secondment with a fixed timeframe that leads to promotion if the position is already available, or inform them that a position is not available if it isn’t before commencing the process.</li>



<li>Encourage them to apply when the opportunity arises and be a sponsor for them and that position.</li>
</ul>



<p>The best you can offer a person as a leader is your mentorship and investment to grow and succeed.</p>



<p>You won’t regret it! </p>



<p>You will find that doing so will result in…</p>



<ul>
<li>Retaining talent</li>



<li>Building a capable culture, team and remove bottlenecks </li>



<li>Have people dedicated to the vision and mission</li>



<li>Build meaningful relationships </li>



<li>Feel good seeing others grow.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Be the leader you wanted and needed</strong> throughout your career.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p><strong>Leadership</strong> is not <strong>management</strong>, and leadership can be independent from management or together.</p>



<ul>
<li>Hire <strong>people</strong> you are going to <strong>invest</strong> in to grow</li>



<li>Allocate <strong>time</strong> to ensure you can <strong>invest</strong> in people</li>



<li><strong>Don’t</strong> prevent career progression due to lack of experience
<ul>
<li>Attitude and willingness is most important</li>



<li>Experience can be gained but it <strong>MUST</strong> start somewhere</li>



<li>Give people you have hired that experience, be it on the job or by investing in them before the opportunity presented itself</li>



<li>Set them up for success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, Good leadership is tough, ensure you take the time to also recharge yourself.</p>
