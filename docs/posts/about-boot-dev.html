           <p>We think the smartest way to learn to code is to make sure you’re never bored.</p>
<h2 id="the-story">
  <span> The Story</span> <a href="#the-story">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I originally built <a href="https://www.boot.dev">Boot.dev</a> for my wife Breanna so she could transition from being an x-ray tech to a back-end developer, but we ran into a few problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>We didn’t have the time or money for a 4-year CS degree, but I felt a lot of the core CS concepts were important</li>
<li>As a hiring manager, I found that many resources don’t focus enough on building projects</li>
<li>We found plenty of places to learn front-end development, but not back-end</li>
<li>Few people fail because coding is too hard, they fail because they lose motivation</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided it would be fun to build a course that incorporates a lot of the fun aspects of RPG games and started Boot.dev as a side project. My wife was my first student and loves the courses, so I hope you do too.</p>

  <span> Our Beliefs</span> <a href="#our-beliefs">🔗</a></h2>
<p>We have some opinions about how you should learn to code.</p>
<ol>
<li>Coding is fun, don’t ruin it</li>
<li>Computer science matters, degrees don’t</li>
<li>You need to build</li>
<li>You need to deploy</li>
<li>It’s hard to find good resources</li>
<li>Learning to code is a depth-first algorithm</li>
<li>It’s a marathon, not a sprint</li>
<li>You should be uncomfortable</li>
<li>Get an on-site, full-time job first</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-coding-is-fun-dont-ruin-it">

<blockquote>
<p>A game is a series of interesting choices</p>
<p>– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier">Sid Meier</a>, creator of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)">Civilization</a> series</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coding is <em>inherently</em> a game. There’s a tight feedback loop, and you get to make interesting decisions about the code you write that moves you toward your goal: building a project that does something useful.</p>
<p>Coding, and in particular <em>learning to code</em>, can become dull if the magic is lost. We do everything we can to keep that magic alive. We think there are a few critical elements to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything should be learned through hands-on coding lessons</li>
<li>All concepts should be taught within the context of a real-world software project</li>
<li>Game elements like achievements and quests can supply boosts of external motivation and sweet, sweet dopamine</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-computer-science-matters-degrees-dont">
  <span> 2. Computer science matters, degrees don’t</span> <a href="#2-computer-science-matters-degrees-dont">🔗</a></h3>
<p>People are becoming more tech-literate every day, and that’s a wonderful thing. Deploying a simple website doesn’t require advanced programming knowledge anymore. That doesn’t mean we no longer need smart engineers, <em>we do.</em> They just work on more interesting problems, and at a different scale.</p>
<p>Mastering computer science concepts like algorithms, data structures, functional programming, and cryptography is a great way to differentiate yourself as a developer, and universities needn’t be the gatekeepers of that knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="3-you-need-to-build">
  <span> 3. You need to build</span> <a href="#3-you-need-to-build">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Too many self-taught learners watch hours of YouTube tutorials, only to find that they don’t know where to start when building their own projects.</p>
<p>The tighter your feedback loop, the better. Our courses teach new concepts through hands-on coding exercises, then you go use those concepts in your own projects that you build from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="4-you-need-to-deploy">
  <span> 4. You need to deploy</span> <a href="#4-you-need-to-deploy">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes “deploy” means to host a web app on the internet. Sometimes it just means packaging up your project with great documentation and pushing it to GitHub.</p>
<p>The point is you need to <em>show your work</em>, and that work should be <em>interesting</em> if you want a better chance of landing a job.</p>
<h3 id="5-its-hard-to-find-good-resources">
  <span> 5. It’s hard to find good resources</span> <a href="#5-its-hard-to-find-good-resources">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The internet is estimated to host over 100 Zettabytes of data. That’s about 100 <em>trillion</em> gigabytes of data. If you’re learning to code, you don’t need <em>more</em> information, you need a curated roadmap of the <em>most important</em> information packaged in a way that’s easy to digest.</p>
<h3 id="6-learning-to-code-is-a-depth-first-algorithm">
  <span> 6. Learning to code is a depth-first algorithm</span> <a href="#6-learning-to-code-is-a-depth-first-algorithm">🔗</a></h3>
<p>So many learners jump from one shiny technology to the next, sometimes on a daily or weekly basis. The way tech news operates incentivizes this behavior, but it’s <em>not</em> the best way to learn to code.</p>
<p>Err on the side of going deep into a topic or technology that interests you. There is a time to branch out, but I rarely see learners going <em>too</em> deep.</p>
<h3 id="7-its-a-marathon-not-a-sprint">
  <span> 7. It’s a marathon, not a sprint</span> <a href="#7-its-a-marathon-not-a-sprint">🔗</a></h3>
<p>You’re not going to “learn to code” in 3 months, but you also don’t need to spend a full 4 years in college to get a job.</p>
<p>We believe that it will take <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/backend/how-long-to-become-backend-dev/">about 12 months</a> to get ready for your first back-end development job, depending on your situation.</p>
<h3 id="8-you-should-be-uncomfortable">
  <span> 8. You should be uncomfortable</span> <a href="#8-you-should-be-uncomfortable">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Learning to code isn’t easy. If it were, everyone would be doing it, and we wouldn’t be paid as much as we are to write good code.</p>
<p>You learn most effectively when you’re in your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development">zone of proximal development</a>, the place just <em>outside</em> of your comfort zone. There are just two rules for staying in the ZOPD:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t waste your time solving problems that you already know how to solve</li>
<li>Don’t waste your time solving problems that are impossible for your skill level</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="9-get-an-on-site-full-time-job-first">
  <span> 9. Get an on-site, full-time job first</span> <a href="#9-get-an-on-site-full-time-job-first">🔗</a></h3>
<p><em>We are from the US. The advice that follows may be less applicable in other countries.</em></p>
<p>Many developers think that landing, managing, and servicing freelancing clients is easier than passing a coding interview. That’s almost always wrong.</p>
<p>If your situation permits, try to <em>get an on-site full-time job as quickly as you can</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll be physically around other developers who can mentor you</li>
<li>You’ll get to focus on coding instead of landing clients and marketing yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>There are exceptions, and any paid development work is typically better than none, but hopefully, this helps provide some focus.</p>
