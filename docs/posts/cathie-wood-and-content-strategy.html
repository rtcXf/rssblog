        <h1>Cathie Wood and Content Strategy</h1>
        <section>
            
            <p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/ranjanxroy">Ranjan here</a>. This week I&#8217;ll be writing about the ARK Innovation ETF and how its founder/owner/analyst has hacked the media in a brilliant way.</em></p><p>You may have noticed my co-host <a href="https://twitter.com/can">Can</a> has taken a recent writing break. He just <a href="https://www.felt.com/">started a new company</a> so we'll excuse him, but <a href="https://themargins.substack.com/p/everything-is-content-now">in his last post</a> he posed the somewhat existential question of &#8216;<em>what is content</em>?&#8217; This led to us uncomfortably passing each other by at the Slack watercooler, as my job is "content strategist", so, to my co-host Can, I&#8217;d like to lay out an example of an utterly brilliant, perfectly executed, comprehensive, content strategy. </p><p>I present to you The Case of Cathie Wood.</p><h2>Brain Real Estate</h2><p>Great content strategy understands that content is much more than words written into paragraphs or a person talking to a camera. It&#8217;s numbers and stories and emotion all intertwined to drive feedback loops and desired actions. It's a compelling story that ends up occupying some amount of our collective thinking.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Cathie Wood runs a portfolio of ETFs. The flagship and most famous one is <a href="https://ark-funds.com/">the ARK Innovation ETF</a> (ARKK). ETFs used to be kind of a boring financial vehicle that tracked other existing indices or portfolios. While you couldn't technically "buy" the Nasdaq 100, you could buy the QQQ ETF which would give you a fairly close proximation of its performance. Stuff started to get weird with things like triple-levered reverse ETFs (where you'd be promised 3x the opposite of an index, yes these are real) but the ARK Innovation ETF is kind of an entirely different animal - it&#8217;s an actively managed ETF and doesn&#8217;t track some other index or portfolio. The stocks included are picked by the ARK team and the ETF gives everyday investors easy access to what Cathie Wood and her team would consider the disruptive companies that will transform business and society.</p><p>There&#8217;s been a lot of writing about the mechanics <a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/potential-liquidity-issues-at-ark">of the ARKK financial vehicle itself</a>, but this post is about telling Can how this product that, at its core, is effectively a spreadsheet of stocks, has used content to dominate both the financial conversation and deliver pretty spectacular returns (150% over the last year, 52% a year in the past 5 years).</p><h2><strong>Everything is Content</strong></h2><p>Normally when we think of financial content marketing, we think of corporate blogs, quarterly investor letters, media appearances. Things have progressed a bit as you now have Ray Dalio LinkedIns and Clifford Asness tweets, but traditionally investors have been a bit reticent to open up their books. Their investment theses and decisions were their competitive advantage, and there&#8217;s a bunch of compliance reasons they&#8217;d need to be careful about what they say. </p><p>But financial content isn&#8217;t simply as things like a Warren Buffett shareholder letter or a Bill Ackman CNBC appearance.</p><p>Let&#8217;s first step back and look at ways companies use non-traditional forms of content to try to drive business outcomes.</p><p>Think about something like good technical documentation. It can play a huge marketing role in building lucrative developer communities and can drive word of mouth marketing far better than promotional videos created by the marketing team. (Can told me he'd consider <a href="https://stripe.com/docs">Stripe</a> the gold standard for documentation, with <a href="https://observablehq.com/">ObservableHQ</a> as a close 2nd).</p><p>There are other customer-oriented ways to think about this - like how Zappos approached service phone calls (they famously had one that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PloPddCWAjE">lasted 10 hours, 43 minutes</a>, that&#8217;s content, Can!) - but you can extend this even beyond written and spoken words. </p><p>It could be open-source datasets for others to create with. This might be a bit of a stretch, but I&#8217;d argue the very idea of open-source software is a form of content marketing. It introduces people to the way you think and what you do while building brand awareness far more effectively than any number of high-gloss commercials. Facebook's developer community is certainly better content than its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSzoDPptYNA">Chairs commercial</a> (this is just an excuse to, once again, include this video).</p><div id="youtube2-SSzoDPptYNA" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;SSzoDPptYNA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SSzoDPptYNA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><h2><strong>ARKK and Transparency</strong></h2><p>Cathie Wood's firm has been lauded as creating a new level of transparency. </p><p>They create things that we&#8217;d all consider standard content. There is <a

You won&#8217;t see it written down except maybe in a journalism professor&#8217;s research. But it includes timeliness, conflict, anything totally unexpected, anything seemingly consequential, anything that involves a charismatic person whose human interest looms large in the news, and so on.</p><p>Trump has hacked the newsworthiness code by being newsworthy in the traditional sense every day, many times a day. He dominates the public conversation. He overwhelms journalists trying to process all this news. He exhausts the patience of the public. And he throws off so many false or misleading statements that he breaks the controls or checks on that as well.</p></blockquote><p>You see it in how the financial press covers this as a disinterested analyst simple analyzing and tries to cover that analysis in a detached, objective manner. It&#8217;s the way financial research has worked for years so why would this be any different? </p><h2>Gatekeepers</h2><p>In this whole weird tech vs. media thing, the term &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; has been pejoratively thrown at journalists. As someone who is (<em>checks notes</em>) not a journalist, and (<em>checks notes</em>) even does a lot of PR work for a venture-funded tech company, I find it an odd insult. Journalists are supposed to be gatekeepers because there is something behind that gate worth keeping. Someone, somewhere has to be a check on something. That&#8217;s the whole point! Cathie Wood&#8217;s content strategy, and for that matter, any corporate communications effort, only works this effectively when the media relinquishes that role. </p><p>Any good content strategy pushes your message out to drive specific outcomes. For any businessperson, of course, you&#8217;re going to want to bypass and/or co-opt the media because that means you&#8217;ll sell more widgets. ARK&#8217;s goal is even cleaner than most other businesses - it&#8217;s to get more people to buy the stocks they own. </p><p>I can promise you, I'm not some virulently anti-Cathie Wood person. I wasn't even really familiar with the ARK story until the beginning of this year. As we&#8217;re indirectly talking about Tesla here, for full disclosure (<strong>Note 1</strong>), while I respect the Cathie Wood content strategy for its subtlety and originality, I don&#8217;t feel the same way about Elon Musk and his more brute force, Trumpian media-hacking style of content.</p><p>But any regular reader will certainly know <a href="https://themargins.substack.com/p/zirp-explains-the-world">my greatest bugbear</a> is the current distortion, <a href="https://themargins.substack.com/p/exasperated-exuberance">and borderline absurdity</a>, of the financial markets. It&#8217;s why the content strategist in me finds the way ARK does content so deviously brilliant, yet the person who lives in society and is trying to plan the next few decades of my financial future finds it utterly frustrating. But Cathie Wood is doing what Cathie Wood should do, and we should all just recognize it for what it is - a great content strategy. Pushing out daily trade notifications to drive the daily conversation towards your portfolio while an unquestioning press eats it up, all with a grandiose story about disruptive innovation is working really well.
