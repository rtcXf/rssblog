  <span> <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-job-search">1. New Learn to Get a Job Course</a></span> <a href="#1-new-learn-to-get-a-job-coursehttpswwwbootdevcourseslearn-job-search">🔗</a></h3>
<p>I’ve been slowly building this course in the shadows for awhile, collecting all the best job search advice from coworkers, hiring managers, and even my podcast guests. This is an info course that will guide you through the process of creating a portfolio or projects, resume, GitHub profile, etc. I even talk about the best ways to source job opportunities, and how to prepare for interviews.</p>
<p>The course is in private beta at the moment! It will be fully released this week. If you’d like early access (realize there might be some rough edges) you can use the link above.</p>

  <span> 2. Big updates to Boots</span> <a href="#2-big-updates-to-boots">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Boots, our amazing in-app AI mentor has undergone some serious improvements. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPT 4 instead of GPT 3.5</li>
<li>He now uses the <a href="https://tilt.colostate.edu/the-socratic-method/">Socratic teaching method</a> to help you solve problems instead of just giving you the answer</li>
<li>Chat-first, meaning you now just strike up a conversation instead of highlighting code</li>
<li>One-click button to include your code in the chat</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-new-notification-system">
  <span> 3. New notification system</span> <a href="#3-new-notification-system">🔗</a></h3>
<p>We added a bell icon to the top left of the screen where all your quest completions, course completions, and achievements will be shown. We’ll be iterating on that UI in the coming months. Our goal is to make the notifications less obtrusive (a modal used to popup in your face), but also make sure you don’t miss anything.</p>

<p>by RaspberryPi</p>
<p>In some ways I owe my early career to Raspberry Pi. My first job was writing low level scripts on a Raspberry Pi that interacted with hardware sensors and pushed data to a web server. That was with a Pi 2 and Pi 3, and now the 5 is being released! If you’re interested in building software projects that interact with the real world, I highly recommend looking into the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>by Melkey</p>
<p>I clicked on this video in my YouTube feed expecting to disagree with Melkey because I have strong opinions about web frameworks in Go, but we are on the same page for the most part! In a nutshell, you don’t need a heavy handed web framework with an ORM and all that, and there a bunch of lightweight routing libraries that do a great job in Go. Give this one a watch.</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, it’s my article. But this is my newsletter so I can plug my own stuff if I want. I had a lot fo fun writing this one, because this topic has been on my mind a lot recently. In a nutshell, coding is hard and if you wanna succeed you need to be prepared to take the longer road, there aren’t any shortcuts.</p>
