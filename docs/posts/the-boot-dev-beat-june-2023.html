           <p>May was a historic month for Boot.dev. We added more students to the backend learning path than we ever have in a single month before, and we’re doing everything we can to build and release new, better courses at a faster clip. Thanks for hanging out and learning with us.</p>
<p>All the best, Lane</p>

<p>Backend Banter is our brand new podcast about backend technologies and careers! We’ve released 3 episodes so far, and we’re releasing a new one every Monday. You can watch to the video version on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw1W1TeNPmy6_qwxibW_51XhkuYYRBDLK">YouTube</a> or subscribe on your <a href="https://www.backendbanter.fm">favorite podcast player</a>.</p>

<p>Optional challenges at the end of each chapter continue to be a popular request, and we now have them for the first 4 courses in the learning path:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-code-python">Learn Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python">Learn OOP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-algorithms-python">Learn Algorithms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-data-structures-python">Learn Data Structures</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Allan made some significant updates to the “Boots” bot in the Discord. Not only does he have much more personality now, but the way karma is awarded for helping others has been updated and is much more transparent.</p>

<p>Alongside your weekly quest, you can now also accept a <em>daily</em> quest!</p>
<p>Daily quests are smaller, more bite-sized tasks that you can complete in a single day. They earn you XP instead of gems, so completing your dailies will actually help you in your progress toward your weekly quest.</p>

<p>The Cup o Go podcast had me on to talk about Boot.dev, the backend learning path, and my experience as a Go developer building and education platform. It was a lot of fun, you might enjoy it.</p>
