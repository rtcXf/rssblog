           <p>The “learn computer science basics” section of the backend developer learning path is now complete! We have no big plans to make serious modifications (tbh I always say this though, so idk). To be clear, that’s the first half of the track complete - the first 13 courses up to the personal project.</p>
<p>Elatedly, Lane</p>

  <span> 1. New Course: <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-memory-management-c">Learn Memory Management</a></span> <a href="#1-new-course-learn-memory-managementhttpswwwbootdevcourseslearn-memory-management-c">🔗</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.boot.dev/teachers/tj-devries">TJ DeVries</a> spent nine months perfecting this incredible course on memory management in C. It will teach your how to manually manage memory in C and you’ll even build your own garbage collector from scratch.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever hung out on our <a href="https://www.boot.dev/community">Discord server</a>, you’ll know that the <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-functional-programming-python">Functional Programming course</a> is one of the larger difficulty spikes on the platform. As such, we’ve created a free 2+ hour walkthrough of the course in collaboration with Travvy. Check it out</p>
<h3 id="3-http-servers-and-blog-aggregator-updates">
  <span> 3. HTTP Servers and Blog Aggregator Updates</span> <a href="#3-http-servers-and-blog-aggregator-updates">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The old <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-servers-golang">HTTP Servers course</a> was <em>before</em> the SQL section, and the <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-blog-aggregator">blog aggregator</a> was <em>after</em> the SQL section. We’ve made drastic updates to those courses and moved their positions a bit within the track. The takeaways are that, aside from being new and improved overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>The HTTP Servers course now uses a PostgreSQL database instead of flat files</li>
<li>The Blog Aggregator course is now a CLI tool, which makes using and testing it <em>way</em> easier and more fun</li>
<li>Both now have auto-reset functionality, so no more failed submissions due to a bad database state</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-as-of-today-10185-issue-tickets-closed">
  <span> 4. As of Today, 10,185 Issue Tickets Closed</span> <a href="#4-as-of-today-10185-issue-tickets-closed">🔗</a></h3>
<p>You know that little “report issue” button on each lesson? We take those reports <em>very</em> seriously. Over Boot.dev’s lifespan, we’ve closed 10,185 of those tickets (which is actually fewer than the total number or <em>reports</em> because we batch all the reports on a given lesson into a single ticket). Anyhow, thanks so much for all the feedback. We’re always listening, and we spend as much time updating existing content as we do creating new content.</p>
<p>There are only 64 tickets <em>open</em> as I type this - we close hundreds per week.</p>
<h3 id="5-miscellaneous-improvements">
  <span> 5. Miscellaneous improvements</span> <a href="#5-miscellaneous-improvements">🔗</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A new privacy toggle to keep your achievements and profile private if you choose (tbh you probably shouldn’t but you know, whatever)</li>
<li>Removed confusing “positional args” options from the Bootdev CLI</li>
<li>Audio player UI enhancements</li>
<li>Some new boss fight mechanics (you’ll see soon…)</li>
<li>Collapsible sections in the lesson instructions</li>
<li>New fancy button (and more new fancy buttons coming)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-yet-to-come">
  <span> What is yet to come</span> <a href="#what-is-yet-to-come">🔗</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A big update to streaks - they will now be daily instead of weekly, and frozen flames will only protect you for 3 days instead of 7</li>
<li>Spellbooks (Grimoires? Tomes? idk). We’re aiming to solve several <em>hugely</em> requested features in one fell swoop. Bookmarks, note taking, and cheat sheets all wrapped up into one UI feature. Stay tuned.</li>
<li>A big update to the data structures course</li>
<li>New Track Option: The second half of the backend development track in TypeScript</li>
</ul>
