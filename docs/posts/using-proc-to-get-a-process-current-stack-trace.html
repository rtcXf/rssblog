      <p>Hey,</p>
<p>The file covered in this article, <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/stack</code>, is the one that motivated me to learn more about <code>/proc</code> and get <a href="https://ops.tips/blog/a-month-of-proc"><code>The Month of Proc</code></a>.</p>
<p>It’s such a useful thing when you’re unaware of what is the state of a given process. Meanwhile, I’ve noticed that it’s not very well known by people getting started with Linux.</p>

<p>Here in this post, you’ll get to know more about how procfs can gather a process&#39; stack trace, as well as get an idea of its usefulness.</p>

<h3 id="a-process-that-blocks">A process that blocks</h3>
<p>To kick things off, let’s start with the tailoring of a process that blocks - a TCP server.</p>
<p>In its most simplistic form, we can have a single-threaded TCP server that just receives traffic in a given thread and then processes its results.</p>
<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://ops.tips/blog/-/images/tcp-server-blocking-main-thread.svg" alt="Illustration of TCP server blocking the main thread "/>

    
</figure>

<p>Naturally, there are two places where we can see the server blocking: at the <code>accept(2)</code> phase, of the <code>read(2)</code> phase - the first blocks until a client finishes the TCP handshake; the second, until data is available for read.</p>
<p>Here’s how a simplistic implementation in C would look like considering just the first blocking part (<code>accept</code>ing):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/**
</span><span> * server_listen takes care of setting up the
</span><span> * passive socket that receives incoming TCP
</span><span> * connections.
</span><span> *
</span><span> * Returns the file descriptor corresponding to
</span><span> * the passive socket, of -1 in the case of
</span><span> * error.
</span><span> *
</span><span> * See https://ops.tips/blog/a-tcp-server-in-c/#creating-a-socket
</span><span> * for a reference implementation.

<h3 id="viewing-the-process-kernel-stack-trace">Viewing the process kernel stack trace</h3>
<p>Once the server is blocked, we can jump into <code>/proc</code> and check out what’s going on in the Kernel and figure out that it’s blocked on the <code>accept</code> syscall:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Gather the in-kernel stack trace of</span>
<span># the `accept.out` process (the simplistic</span>
<span># TCP server that we&#39;re running).</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Although it might look like a weird stack trace at first, the structure is very straightforward to reason about.</p>
<p>Each line represents a function that was called (from looking at the stack calls), having the first part, that <code>[&lt;0&gt;]</code> thing, being the kernel address of the function, while the second, that <code>do_syscall_64+...</code> being the symbol name with the corresponding offset.</p>
<p>If <code>[&lt;0&gt;]</code> looks weird (like, not an actual address at all), it’s because it’s intended to be like that.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/d8a5b80568a9cb66810e75b182018e9edb68e8ff/fs/proc/base.c#L424-L453"><code>fs/proc/base.c#proc_pid_stack</code></a> (the method that gets called by the <code>/proc</code> implementation of the virtual filesystem) iterates over the stack frames, we can see that it hardcodes <code>[&lt;0&gt;]</code> as the address to be displayed:</p>

    proc: don&#39;t report kernel addresses in /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/stack

    This just changes the file to report them as zero, although maybe even
    that could be removed.  I checked, and at least procps doesn&#39;t actually
    seem to parse the &#39;stack&#39; file at all.

    And since the file doesn&#39;t necessarily even exist (it requires
    CONFIG_STACKTRACE), possibly other tools don&#39;t really use it either.

    That said, in case somebody parses it with tools, just having that zero
    there should keep such tools happy.

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/printk-formats.txt">docs for <code>printk</code> format specifiers</a>, we can see what that very specialized formatting is all about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>B</code> specifier results in the symbol name with offsets and should be used when printing stack backtraces.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[The <code>K</code> specifier is used …] For printing kernel pointers which should be hidden from unprivileged users.</p>

<p>Meaning that yeah, previously you <em>could</em> retrieve the kernel addresses, but not anymore, for the reasons presented by Linus.</p>
<h3 id="when-the-stack-does-not-help-much">When the stack does not help much</h3>

</code></pre></div><p>Notice that differently from the C code, here I’m looking at the stack of each task under the task group identified by the PID of the <code>go_accept</code> command.</p>
<p>Given that Go will run more than one thread when it starts (so that we can schedule goroutines to run across the poll of actual threads), we can take a look at the stack across all of the threads and see their stack (in the end, each thread is a <code>task</code>, so we can take the stack of each of them).</p>
<p>If we use <a href="https://github.com/derekparker/delve"><code>dlv</code></a>, we can see why it’s the case that we have those 5 threads just waiting with a <code>futex_wait</code>, while there’s another one blocked on <code>ep_poll</code> (the actual block on async IO):</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Having now both the userspace and kernelspace stacks, we can properly identify what’s going on with the Go application.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>The conclusion? IMO, <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/stack</code> (or the equivalent <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/task/&lt;task_id&gt;/stack</code>) is great, but it only takes us so far.</p>
<p>In the end, we need a mix of userspace and kernel space tools that can help us debug the state in which a system is present.</p>
<p>Luckily, from time to time new tools like <code>dlv</code> show up, <code>pprof</code> improves, and even more powerful tools to inspect the Kernel emerge.</p>
