           <p>I talk to boatloads of students who are starting to <a href="https://www.boot.dev">learn to code</a>, and invariably they are hyper-concerned about which programming languages and technologies they should be learning.</p>
<p>Now, first of all, I don’t think it matters all that much. You don’t fail to break into tech because you learned JavaScript instead of Python, or Go instead of Rust. You fail for a bunch of other reasons, chief among them being a lack of dedication, time, and focus.</p>
<p>That said, choosing good technologies to learn can certainly help. Unfortunately, almost everyone I talk to is only concerned with one metric: <em>the total number of jobs for a given technology</em>.</p>
<p>This is a mistake.</p>

<h2 id="the-total-number-of-jobs-doesnt-matter">
  <span> The total number of jobs doesn’t matter</span> <a href="#the-total-number-of-jobs-doesnt-matter">🔗</a></h2>
<p>According to Stack Overflow’s latest survey, JavaScript is <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages">the most popular programming language in the world</a>, both for people learning to code as well as professional developers.</p>
<p>I also did a quick search on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs">LinkedIn Jobs</a> for “JavaScript” and “Golang” jobs. Here are the results:</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript: 477,512 open positions in the US</li>
<li>Golang: 61,673 open positions in the US</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at those numbers and think “I should learn JavaScript because there are more jobs”, you’re not alone, but you’re wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t matter how many total jobs there are, because you only need to land <em>one</em>.</p>
<p>– me</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="looking-at-the-ratios">
  <span> Looking at the ratios</span> <a href="#looking-at-the-ratios">🔗</a></h2>
<p>To dive deeper I went to <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=learn%20javascript,learn%20golang&amp;hl=en">Google Trends</a> and looked at the number of people searching for the terms “Learn JavaScript” and “Learn Golang” over the last 12 months. Here was the ratio:</p>
<p>JavaScript: 73
Golang: 6</p>
<p><em>73/6 is the ratio of people searching for “Learn JavaScript” to people searching for “Learn Golang”. Google Trends, like the Sith, doesn’t deal in absolutes.</em></p>
<p>So, let’s do some more math:</p>
<p>JavaScript jobs to Golang jobs: <code>477,512 / 61,673 = 7.7</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>7.7 JavaScript jobs for every 1 Golang job</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JavaScript learners to Golang learners: <code>73 / 7 = 10.4</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>10.4 JavaScript learners for every 1 Golang learner</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, the “competition ratio”: <code>10.4 / 7.7 = 1.4</code></p>
<p>Based on these numbers, I’d estimate that your competition for JavaScript jobs is about 1.4x higher than your competition for Golang jobs. According to this completely scientific and in no-way fallible analysis, it looks like Go might be a better choice if you’re trying to minimize your competition for jobs.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-trust-these-numbers">
  <span> Can I trust these numbers?</span> <a href="#can-i-trust-these-numbers">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I don’t know, probably not. My goal here isn’t to convince you to learn Go, Python, Rust, JavaScript, or anything else for that matter. I just want you to think about the job market in a slightly different way.</p>
<p>This has been top-of-mind for me lately due to an anecdote from a couple of years ago. I was working as a hiring manager where I was looking for mid-level Go developers. My coworker was hiring mid-level JavaScript developers at the same company. When I opened a new position I would get 10-20 candidates within 2 weeks. He would get 100+ candidates within the same time frame. I felt bad for the JavaScript candidates.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-total-number-of-jobs-matter-at-all">
  <span> Does the total number of jobs matter at all?</span> <a href="#does-the-total-number-of-jobs-matter-at-all">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Yes, but I prefer to think of it as a threshold. Like, if there are only 100 total jobs for a given technology, even if you’re one of ten people in the world who knows it, you’re going to be entering a very niche market that could dry up at any moment.</p>
<p>It’s like, “is what I’m learning sufficiently popular that I can reasonably expect to find a job”? If it is, then I’d argue the next most important metric is the ratio of candidates to jobs.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-matters">
  <span> What else matters?</span> <a href="#what-else-matters">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The next thing to consider is your location. Remote work is great, but I’m a big fan of junior devs trying to <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/about/#9-get-an-on-site-full-time-job-first">work on-site</a> for at least a year or two. You’ll learn faster, and you’ll actually have an easier time landing a job in the first place (assuming you’re in a place with some jobs). When you compete for a local job, you’re only competing against people who live in your city, not the entire world.</p>
<p>If Python has tons of jobs, and a fantastic ratio of candidates to jobs, but where you live the only developer openings are for Go and Java, then I’d recommend reconsidering your choice of technology.</p>
<h2 id="please-dont-worry-about-it-too-much">
  <span> Please don’t worry about it too much</span> <a href="#please-dont-worry-about-it-too-much">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Like I said at the outset, you won’t fail to break into tech because you didn’t choose the perfect stack to learn.</p>
<p>If you go about learning to code by going <em>deep</em> on the basics, you can always learn new technologies as you go. Fundamental concepts like problem-solving, imperative programming, data structures, algorithms, architecture, clean code, io, networking, HTTP, REST, databases, and caching are <em>universal and language-agnostic</em>. If you know how to build a REST API in Go, spinning one up in Express or Django is going to be a quick learning curve.</p>
<p>Syntax is the easy part. Best of luck out there.</p>
