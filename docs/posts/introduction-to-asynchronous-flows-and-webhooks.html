            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
           <p>In this post, we‚Äôll be talking about coding with a common integration pattern with an external API called a
<em>webhook</em>. Loosely speaking, there are three main types of communication you‚Äôll see when building an
application.</p>
<ol>
<li>Frontend to Backend.</li>
<li>Your backend to an external backend (API).</li>
<li>An external backend to your backend (API).</li>
</ol>

<p>When first learning to code, we focus largely on the first two. However, in practice, the third type, commonly known as
a <strong>webhook</strong>, is also prevalent. Before we get started, let‚Äôs settle on some terminology.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-asynchronous-flow-and-why-are-they-important">
  <span> What is an asynchronous flow and why are they important?</span> <a href="#what-is-an-asynchronous-flow-and-why-are-they-important">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs start first with what you probably already know. When you send an HTTP request to an API and expect an immediate
response, that is a <strong>synchronous call</strong>. Your code <em>waits</em> for the API to respond, and ties up resources on your
server while it is servicing that request. The resources tied up differs depending on your language and web framework,
but typically a thread is tied up, or at the very least CPU time and RAM are consumed while waiting.</p>
<p>While this is sufficient for most applications, eventually you will come across a scenario where synchronous
communication does not fit the bill. Some examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>The request you sent to the external API is computationally expensive - waiting for a synchronous response will
result in a timeout, which depending on the platform is typically between 10 and 30 seconds.</li>
<li>The external API or platform will not have an immediate answer for your request. A common use case here would be a
workflow requiring a human on the other side to complete a task before responding to you.</li>
</ol>
<p>An asynchronous flow is any type of
communication between two parties that is not immediate. You might send a request to an API and get an immediate
response, but you will not get any data of good use (don‚Äôt worry if this doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense now, we‚Äôll explain
further in the example below).</p>
<p>This eliminates the need for both parties to be available for your request at the same time, making it ideal for
applications that involve a human in the loop or are computationally expensive.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-webhook">
  <span> What is a webhook?</span> <a href="#what-is-a-webhook">üîó</a></h3>
<p>Now that we know what an asynchronous flow is, what is a webhook? Put simply, a webhook is a call to <strong>your API</strong>
that is the result of an event that happened in an external system. Webhooks allow applications to communicate in real-time, but asynchronously.</p>
<p>Rolling with the example provided above, imagine you‚Äôre tasked with integrating with a Help Desk company that provides
agents that reviews documents your users submit.</p>
<ol>
<li>You make an API call to the Help Desk company with the location of the document for them to review.</li>
<li>That API call immediately responds with an <code>agentId</code> representing the agent assigned to the case, a <code>documentId</code>,
and a status of <code>PENDING_REVIEW</code> for the case.</li>
<li>When the agent reviews the document, it is ultimately marked as <code>ACCEPTED</code> or <code>DECLINED</code>. At this time, the Help
Desk company will trigger a <strong>webhook</strong>, call your API, tell you the status, along with the <code>documentId</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For completeness, I will call out that there are other ways to solve this problem, such as API Polling, but we will
avoid discussion of API Polling as webhooks are much more efficient.</p>
<p>Now that we have the terminology settled, let‚Äôs run through an example below.</p>
<p>This code is all available <a href="https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks">here</a>, so you can either follow along

<h2 id="prerequisites">
  <span> Prerequisites</span> <a href="#prerequisites">üîó</a></h2>
<p>In order to complete this section, you‚Äôll need a few things set up on your machine.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">NodeJS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">NPM</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker &amp; Docker Compose</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-situated">
  <span> Getting Situated</span> <a href="#getting-situated">üîó</a></h2>
<p>First off, we‚Äôll be working in TypeScript and using a framework called <a href="https://adonisjs.com/">AdonisJS</a>
(don‚Äôt be too worried about this, I‚Äôll hold your hand through anything not obvious.)</p>
<p>In our repository, we have a few different components set up via docker containers. If you‚Äôre not familiar with docker,
there‚Äôs a great course on <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-docker">docker in the boot.dev curriculum</a>, although it‚Äôs not
required to have any knowledge of docker for this article.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôd like to take a look at our docker containers for this article, all of the components are defined in our
<code>docker-compose.yml</code> file <a href="https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/blob/264749d1f1fbebc0682a61e9be2fd0033f6a1ed1/docker-compose.yml">here</a>.
Let‚Äôs step through what each component is.</p>
<ol>
<li>We have the <code>adonis_app</code> which we‚Äôll be using to call our external API.</li>
<li>We also have an <code>external_api</code>, which is somewhat self-explanatory. This is the ‚ÄúHelp Desk‚Äù API that we‚Äôll be
calling that we can expect a webhook from at a later time.</li>
<li>In addition, there‚Äôs a <code>postgres</code> container, as we‚Äôll need to store some data along the way.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs also a <code>redis</code> container, but we won‚Äôt be touching it, it‚Äôs solely to facilitate our artificial webhook
delay.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the routes in <code>api/routes/start.ts</code>, which is where we‚Äôll be doing our implementation, and also in
<code>external/routes/start.ts</code> for the external API (these are already implemented for you).</p>
<p>Alright, what will we be building? Sticking with the example above in our explanation of webhooks, we‚Äôll be calling a
POST endpoint to request a review for a document:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>POST /document

Expected Request Body:
{
   documentUrl: string
}

Expected Response Body:
{
   agentId: string,
   documentId: string
}
</code></pre><p>As you can see, while we want to know if the document has been <code>ACCEPTED</code> or <code>DECLINED</code>, in our help desk world, we need
to wait for a human to review it (the external API will artifically simulate a human review in this case by just waiting 2-5 seconds
before triggering our webhook - you can see this code in <code>external/routes/start.ts</code>)</p>
<p>With that said, here‚Äôs the structure of the payload we can expect to receive in our own API, via webhook.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>POST /document/update

Expected Request Body:
{
   agentId: string,
   documentId: string,
   documentStatus: &#39;ACCEPTED&#39; | &#39;DECLINED&#39;
}
</code></pre><p>Notice how I didn‚Äôt note the Expected Response Body? That‚Äôs because most webhooks don‚Äôt really take much care
to what you respond - as long as you return a 200, 201, or 202 status code, they‚Äôll treat the call as a success and
move on.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">
  <span> Implementation</span> <a href="#implementation">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Before we do anything in this section, you‚Äôll want to pull down the git repository found
<a href="https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/tree/main">here</a>, run <code>git checkout 292dff8f29a75eb7bb70e337ed32116bd9db68d4</code> and then <code>git checkout -b webhook-tutorial</code> to navigate to the proper starting
point.</p>
<p>Once that‚Äôs done, run <code>docker compose up</code> from the root of the repository to bring up all of the containers needed for this
next section.</p>
<h3 id="the-help-desk-api-call">
  <span> The Help Desk API Call</span> <a href="#the-help-desk-api-call">üîó</a></h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs start developing. First, let‚Äôs navigate to the <code>api</code> folder in our terminal and install Axios, a library that
allows you to make HTTP calls with little effort.</p>
<p>Our current project uses NPM, so let‚Äôs add Axios as a dependency:
<code>npm install axios</code>. Resulting commit
<a href="https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/pull/2/commits/92e74a9896d2c4e8254723d58e2c1e8f19530999">here</a>.</p>
<p>A quick rule of thumb here to note if you‚Äôre new to Javascript or Typescript projects, if you see a <code>package-lock.json</code>,
you should use NPM, if you see a <code>yarn.lock</code> in the root instead, you should use Yarn.</p>
<p>Now with Axios installed, let‚Äôs call the external API. We‚Äôre going to set things up so whenever you make a <code>GET</code>
call by visiting a page in the browser, the external API will be called (and subsequently triggering a webhook
afterwards.)</p>
<p>In our <code>api</code> folder, modify <code>routes/start.ts</code> to have the following logic for our base path (right around where you see
<code>return { hello: &#39;world&#39; }</code>).</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>import</span> <span>axios</span> <span>from</span> <span>&#34;axios&#34;</span><span>;</span>

</span></span><span><span>    <span>{</span> <span>documentUrl</span><span>:</span> <span>&#34;https://www.boot.dev/community/&#34;</span> <span>},</span>

</span></span><span><span>  <span>);</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>});</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>A couple of things to note in the commit
<a href="https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/pull/2/commits/2ef39c4afa7bf3138c990cf7673fad79f3299a4b">here</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>In a real, live system, you‚Äôd probably want to define <code>OUR_API</code> and <code>EXTERNAL_API</code> in an environment file. For the
simplicity of this tutorial, we‚Äôve hard coded them.</li>
<li>The first parameter to <code>axios.post</code> is the endpoint you want to hit on the external API. Rolling with our example
of a Help Desk API, we‚Äôre requesting a document review of <code>https://www.boot.dev/community/</code>, which is the second parameter,
the body of the request.</li>
<li>The third parameter defines ‚Äúoptions‚Äù for the request. In this case, we define an <code>X-Callback-Url</code> header, telling
the Help Desk API where we want to receive our webhook when the data is ready for us. The name of this tends to vary
depending on the platform you‚Äôre integrating with - sometimes it‚Äôs also defined as <code>X-Webhook-Url</code> or is defined
manually in an admin panel.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested how webhooks might vary depending on the platform you‚Äôre integrating with, you can check out this
<a href="https://nickabbene.com/developer-experience-local-webhook-routing">blog post</a> which touches upon different types of
webhooks and how to improve your developer experience around them when developing in local environments.</p>
<h3 id="the-webhook">
  <span> The Webhook</span> <a href="#the-webhook">üîó</a></h3>
<p>With all of this confiugured, let‚Äôs get to the meat and potatoes of it all, so we can see the webhook working. We‚Äôll want
to do a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up a database table, we‚Äôll want to store the <code>agentId</code> and <code>documentId</code> from the original response, so we know
what request the webhook belongs to later when we receive it.</li>
<li>Implement the <strong>API Contract</strong>, we‚Äôll need to actually receive the webhook</li>
<li>Test things, and make sure they‚Äôre working as we expect.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="setting-up-the-database">
  <span> Setting up the Database</span> <a href="#setting-up-the-database">üîó</a></h4>
<p>Setting up the database table is relatively straight forward in AdonisJS, from your terminal, run
<code>npm run ace make:model document_review</code> and then <code>npm run ace make:migration document_review</code></p>
<p>This will create the model in AdonisJS, as well as the migration that sets up the database table. You can see the
resulting commit
<a href="https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/commit/696a65ad9756f3c3c8e5884de003a027ae84c149">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs modify the structure of the model and the table to store the variables we‚Äôll need.</p>
<p>In the <code>DocumentReview.ts</code> model file:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="typescript"><span><span><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>class</span> <span>DocumentReview</span> <span>extends</span> <span>BaseModel</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Since we updated these files, we‚Äôll need to actually run the migration, telling AdonisJS to update our database to have
the columns that we need. <code>npm run ace migration:run</code> runs all migrations files that have not been run against our
database yet, so let‚Äôs go ahead and run it. You should see something similar to the following:</p>

<p>Since we already ran <code>docker compose up</code> earlier, all of your containers should be running already. In a web browser,
navigate to <code>http://localhost:3333/</code>.</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt get any response, you‚Äôll have to run <code>docker compose up</code>, and keep your containers up in the background.</p>
<p>A blank page should load. In order, the following happens.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>/</code> route on <code>api/start/routes.ts</code> reaches out to the Help Desk API and stores the variables from the response.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs a delay of approximately 2-5 seconds (if you‚Äôre curious how this works, check out <code>external/start/routes.ts</code>
and <code>external/start/document-subscriber.ts</code>)</li>
<li>The external API calls back to your <code>/document/update</code> endpoint in <code>api/start/routes.ts</code>, updating the
<code>documentStatus</code> field.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you‚Äôre not convinced, I‚Äôve created a utility script under <code>api</code> that allows you to get into your database.</p>
<p>From your terminal, run <code>./local_db.sh</code>. You‚Äôll see a prompt for <code>psql</code>, the command line utility for Postgres.</p>

<p>Now, you can execute the following to see the table contents, feel free to run it in quick succession, to see the
values in the database both before and after the webhook hits your API.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sql"><span><span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>FROM</span><span> </span><span>document_reviews</span><span>;</span><span>

  <span> Going Further</span> <a href="#going-further">üîó</a></h3>
<p>Want to go further and learn more about webhooks? Here are some features you would typically see implemented in a live
environment if you‚Äôre interested in doing some more digging.</p>
<h4 id="retries">
  <span> Retries</span> <a href="#retries">üîó</a></h4>
<p>When a webhook call fails, you‚Äôll need to retry it at a later time. Most <strong>retry policies</strong> have an <a href="https://medium.com/gympass/handling-failed-webhooks-with-exponential-backoff-72d2e01017d7">exponential
backoff</a>. In our example,
this would be implemented in the <code>external</code> API.</p>
<h4 id="refactor-logic-into-a-controller">
  <span> Refactor logic into a controller</span> <a href="#refactor-logic-into-a-controller">üîó</a></h4>
<p>Our implementation currently has all the logic in the <code>routes.ts</code> file. Consider refactoring the logic into a
controller. You can see an example of this with the <code>AuthorizationsController</code>.</p>
<h4 id="write-some-tests">
  <span> Write some tests</span> <a href="#write-some-tests">üîó</a></h4>
<p>No pull request is complete without tests! Feel free to write some.</p>
<h4 id="implement-idempotency">
  <span> Implement idempotency</span> <a href="#implement-idempotency">üîó</a></h4>
<p><a href="https://nickabbene.com/idempotency-to-prevent-duplicates">Learn about idempotency</a>, and implement a middleware for idempotent requests.</p>
<h4 id="validate-the-payload-of-the-request">
  <span> Validate the payload of the request</span> <a href="#validate-the-payload-of-the-request">üîó</a></h4>
<p>What happens if we hit our webhook without the variables we expect? Can we handle it more gracefully?</p>
<h4 id="optimize-your-database-add-indiceshttpswwwcodecademycomarticlesql-indexes">
  <span> Optimize your database, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/sql-indexes">add indices</a></span> <a href="#optimize-your-database-add-indiceshttpswwwcodecademycomarticlesql-indexes">üîó</a></h4>
<p>Our webhook queries the database on the <code>documentId</code> field, which is not an index. If we had many items in the database, the query would be slow.</p>
