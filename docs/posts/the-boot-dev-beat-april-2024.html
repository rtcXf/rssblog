           <p>Pythogoras returned in our second community-wide boss battle. He was vanquished, and there was much rejoicing. Happy coding.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Lane</p>

  <span> 1. New Project: Static Site Generator</span> <a href="#1-new-project-static-site-generator">🔗</a></h3>

<p>This new guided project comes directly after the functional programming course. You’ll build a simple static site generator in Python: it works similarly to Jekyll or Hugo. This is a tough project, but it’s a great way to learn about file I/O, templating, and to put your new object-oriented and functional programming skills to the test.</p>

  <span> 2. Updates to Bosses + New Lore</span> <a href="#2-updates-to-bosses--new-lore">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of all our game mechanics is to encourage great learning habits. As such, we needed to make some updates…</p>
<ul>
<li>Boss battle achievements are no longer competitive, instead, they’re based on the total number of bosses you’ve helped to defeat. We plan to do boss battles on a semi-random schedule every 4-8 weeks.</li>
<li>Bosses are defeated as the community gains XP. We removed the “damage” mechanic, it felt redundant.</li>
<li>You now get a static XP bonus as the event goes along, and it’s based on how many fellow learners are participating.</li>
<li>We’ve added a live feed of the boss’s health and the community’s progress in the event.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-profile-heatmaps">

<p><img src="https://blog.boot.dev/img/800/new-heatmap.png.webp" alt="profile heatmap"/></p>
<p>Your public profile page now includes a GitHub-style heatmap of all your accomplishments on Boot.dev. You can also sync a GitHub account and it will show GitHub commits as well.</p>
<h3 id="4-miscellaneous-improvements">
