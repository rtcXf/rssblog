           <p>Fastest boss defeat in the history of Boot.dev, a new AWS course, embers are live, and my children just won’t stop being sick for more than 4 days at a time. Win some, lose some.</p>
<p>Exhaustedly, Lane</p>

<p>Our brand new <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-file-servers-s3-cloudfront-golang">Learn File Servers and CDNs with S3 and CloudFront</a> just went live! In it, you’ll build the backend of a video management site for YouTubers, learning how to use AWS S3 and CloudFront to store and serve files. The chapters include:</p>
<ol>
<li>File Storage</li>
<li>Caching</li>
<li>AWS S3</li>
<li>Object Storage</li>
<li>Video Streaming</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>CDNs</li>
<li>Resiliency</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s a new addition to the core backend learning path, coming chronologically after the <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-servers-golang">Learn HTTP Servers</a> course.</p>

  <span> 2. Streak Embers are live</span> <a href="#2-streak-embers-are-live">🔗</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.boot.dev/img/800/emberslit.png.webp" alt="embers"/></p>
<p>This has been a <em>much</em> anticipated change to our streak system. Your Boot.dev streak is simply a measure of the number of days in a row that you’ve either completed a lesson or committed to a GitHub repository. Frozen flames are a relatively expensize item that is used to save your streak for 4 days when you are out on vacation or just can’t get to your computer. However, we’ve found that a healthy coding habit doesn’t really need to be 7/7 days of the week - and 5/7 days is perfectly reasonable. Embers solve this. You charge an ember when you go above and beyond for a day, and then when you miss a day in the future, the ember is consumed before any frozen flames, and before the streak is lost. They basically make the “daily” streak into more of a “5 days a week” streak, if you’re putting in a solid effort.</p>

<p>The community rallied this month to defeat “Kills the Joke, Vengeant”. And he wasn’t just defeated, but was truly brutalized - he went down in just over 2 days, our fastest boss kill yet. The lore for Chapter 5, where, (SPOILER AHEAD) Kills the Joke and Mortrunk’s assault on Ruebenberg comes to a head, is <a href="https://www.boot.dev/lore/the-guardian">now live here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="4-more-ui-updates">
  <span> 4. More UI updates</span> <a href="#4-more-ui-updates">🔗</a></h3>
<p>A new progress bar and just in-course navigation menu is live. We’re really happy with the new style, but there are certainly some more tweaks coming based on the UX feedback we’ve received to make it a bit easier to use.</p>
<h3 id="5-miscellaneous-improvements">
  <span> 5. Miscellaneous improvements</span> <a href="#5-miscellaneous-improvements">🔗</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hundreds of small updates to lessons that weren’t making good enough use of the Bootdev CLI</li>
<li>New info modals for all the game features</li>
<li>Silently shipped more TS course versions (expect a big update for the TS track in the coming months)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-yet-to-come">
  <span> What is yet to come</span> <a href="#what-is-yet-to-come">🔗</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>More UI updates, tweaks to mobile view, progress navigation, and a new dashboard</li>
