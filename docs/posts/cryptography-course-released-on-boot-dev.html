            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
           <p>Greetings! We’re excited to announce that we’ve unveiled a brand-new <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-cryptography-golang">cryptography course</a> on <a href="https://www.boot.dev">Boot.dev</a>. We’re convinced that this new experience is truly one of a kind. If you want to learn cryptography while writing real code in the <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang">Go programming language</a>, you should check it out.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-cryptography-golang">get started for free here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-learn-cryptography">
  <span> Why learn cryptography?</span> <a href="#why-learn-cryptography">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Ever wondered how your data is kept safe online? This course will teach you about encryption, password security, ciphers, and more. After you master the fundamentals, you’ll learn how each cryptographic primitive is used in real-world applications.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in becoming a valuable back-end engineer, an understanding of cryptography will set you apart from other candidates that will fail to answer basic security questions.</p>
