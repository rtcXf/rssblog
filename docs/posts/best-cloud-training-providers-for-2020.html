<p>2020 has been a challenging year for many people and many reasons. </p>



<p>However, if we focus in on the cloud and cloud training, it has been a noteworthy year.  </p>



<p>Many cloud training providers have provided free content to help those that have been impacted due to COVID-19.   While others have simply provided free content to help the wider community.  It has been inspiring to see the cloud leaders and community gather together and support one another.  </p>



<p>Cloud solutions are continuing to grow at a rapid rate. Cloud Providers like Amazon (AWS), Google (Google Cloud), and Microsoft (Azure) have been continuing to advance and providing leading cloud platforms in the industry.</p>



<p>There are other available platforms such as Red Hat, VMWare, Rackspace, and others that offer platforms or specialised platforms as well. </p>



<p>So with all of these platforms available, there is a strong and rapidly growing need for qualified and educated employees.</p>

<p>This year has been and is continuing to be an interesting one for A Cloud Guru, with the <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/news/press-release/acloudguru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquisition</a> of Linux Academy and the launch of their <a href="https://go.acloud.guru/1PL_dg_see-the-new-ACG.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new platform</a>.</p>



<p>With the end goal of A Cloud Guru to ultimately provide a single platform supporting most content and features from both A Cloud Guru and Linux Academy, this in turn slightly tweaks my recommendation from being either Linux Academy or A Cloud Guru independently.  </p>



<p>Previously I would have advised based on your learning style and features you are seeking to either get an A Cloud Guru or Linux Academy subscription or if you have the finances available then both, you can read about this in a previous post – <a href="https://robertleggett.blog/2019/12/11/top-5-cloud-training-providers-for-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Cloud Training Providers for 2019</a>.</p>



<p>However given that A Cloud Guru now has a new platform, which has a lot of new features and content including those key features from Linux Academy, and because A Cloud Gurus new platform and Linux Academy are both being updated with the same new content.  </p>



<p>I believe a single subscription to the new A Cloud Gurus platform is the best option.</p>



<p><a href="https://acloud.guru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Cloud Guru</a> is a highly recommended cloud training provider, with hundreds of hours of cloud training courses to help you learn and prepare, with a strong focus on certifications.   </p>



<h3>Pros</h3>



<ul>
<li>Training for AWS, GCP and Azure</li>



<li>The training instructors are very knowledgable in their area of focus, and if you have previously purchased courses you have lifetime access to the content</li>



<li>Supports additional skills like DevOps, BigData, Machine Learning, Security, etc</li>



<li>Contains exam related courses, practice exam, and cloud provider playgrounds to experience and practice exercises with hands-on labs</li>



<li>Has quality videos and trainers</li>



<li>Has a community forum to raise questions</li>



<li>Provides a 7-day trial (<a href="https://acloud.guru/membership">https://acloud.guru/</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://acloud.guru/membership" target="_blank">membership</a>)</li>



<li>Supports grandfather pricing</li>
</ul>



<h3>Cons</h3>



<ul>
<li>Lack of community slack channel to talk and learn from</li>



<li>Can be considered costly when you compare to other online course providers.free </li>



<li>The prices are in USD, EUR, or GBP and the conversion fee adds to the cost, if subscribing outside of the US, Europe or the UK.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Why Choose this provider?</h3>



<ul>
<li>When you are studying for certifications on AWS, GCP or Azure</li>



<li>For exploring in-depth technologies, for instance, Kubernetes, Linux etc</li>



<li>If you want to have a cloud provider playground environment to experiment (<strong>very beneficial</strong>)</li>



<li>To be part of a community to talk and learn from</li>



<li>If you are not running on a budget</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pros</h3>



<ul>
<li>Very knowledgable and talented technical trainer</li>
</ul>



<h3>Cons</h3>



<ul id="block-5566812d-2ec0-47f7-8c4e-255edccad848">

<li>If you have a dedicated GCP course that you would like to learn well</li>



<li>If you are seeking a dedicated GCP certification</li>
</ul>



<h2>Recommendation</h2>



<p>I would highly recommend that you have obtained a subscription to the popular instructor-led cloud training provider <strong>A Cloud Guru.</strong> </p>



<p>It is recommended to make use of the 7 days trial to validate what you get out of the platform and is fantastic for anyone seeking a continuous learning experience and values a deep-dive on topics.</p>



<p>If you are purely focusing on <strong>certifications</strong>, I recommend that you also purchase certification practice tests from the other training providers.</p>



<p>I have found them to be much closer aligned to the actual exams than the practice tests supplied from the popular instructor-led cloud training providers.</p>



<ul>
<li>For GCP I recommend the practice tests from Braincert, you can find the links for this in my previous post – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://robertleggett.blog/2019/09/21/how-i-passed-the-gcp-professional-cloud-architect-exam/">How I Passed my GCP Professional Cloud Architect Exam</a> </li>



<li>For AWS I recommend the practice tests from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonjonbonso/">Jon Bonso</a> or training material from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/user/stephane-maarek/">Stephane Maarek</a> in Udemy.  Additionally you could follow my approach from my previous post –  <a href="https://robertleggett.blog/2018/12/02/how-i-passed-the-aws-certified-solution-architect-associate-exam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How I Passed my AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate Exam</a> </li>



<li>Finally for AWS, GCP or Azure study material that I have used to pass my certifications, you can find the links for this in my previous post – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://robertleggett.blog/2020/06/25/aws-gcp-azure-certification-study-material/" target="_blank">AWS, GCP, Azure certification study material</a></li>
