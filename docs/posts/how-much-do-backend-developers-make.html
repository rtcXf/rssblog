        <h1>How Much Do Backend Developers Make?</h1>
        <section>
            
            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
           <p>The short answer? On average, backend developers make either <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/backend-developer-salary-SRCH_KO0,17.htm">$82,462</a>, <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/back-end-developer/salaries">$95,472</a>, or <a href="https://www.salary.com/research/salary/recruiting/back-end-developer-salary#:~:text=The%20average%20Back%20End%20Developer,have%20spent%20in%20your%20profession.">$104,865</a> per year in base pay depending on who you ask. (I asked Glassdoor, Indeed, and Salary.com respectively.) StackOverflow uses medians instead, and their <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#salary-united-states">survey</a> suggests the <strong>backend developers actually make upwards of $150,000 per year</strong>.</p>
<p>That said, none of those numbers is the full answer. If it were, I wouldn’t be writing this entire post. If you want to know how much backend developers make, those numbers don’t paint the full picture. First of all, not only is there a $70k discrepancy between some of these numbers, but even if they were all the same number, they’re <em>averages and medians.</em> How much backend engineers earn depends on so many things! things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where they live</li>
<li>Who they work for</li>
<li>What skills they have</li>
<li>How good they are at negotiating and interviewing</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we dive into a more comprehensive answer, I want to quickly discuss <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/backend/become-backend-developer/">what backend developers are</a>. Backend developers are programmers that build and maintain the systems that store, process, and secure the data used by websites and apps. (In contrast, front-end developers control what you see and interact with on a browser or app)</p>
<p>Now let’s get into figuring out how much backend developers earn.</p>
<h2 id="are-backend-developers-in-demand">
  <span> Are backend developers in demand?</span> <a href="#are-backend-developers-in-demand">🔗</a></h2>
<p>In short, <em>yes</em>. Backend developers have a high salary (whether it’s $80k or $150k!), solid career prospects, and unshakeable job security because backend developers are in very high demand by very well-funded companies. The Bureau of Labor Statistics unhelpfully groups web developers and digital designers together, but still <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm#tab-1">estimates</a> that for that group, the job outlook for the next decade is set to grow by 23% – much higher than the average job (which is around 5%).</p>
<p>If I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3289579147&amp;geoId=103644278&amp;keywords=back%20end%20developer&amp;location=United%20States&amp;refresh=true">search</a> “back end developer” jobs on LinkedIn, I currently see 48,000+ job openings.</p>
<p>This demand leads to a high salary. It’s worth getting the job.</p>

<p>There are six basic concepts you should know pretty thoroughly if you want to get a job as a backend developer. Looking at how much backend developers make, it’s not an impossible task. Even if you’re a total beginner, we expect you can <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/backend/how-long-to-become-backend-dev/">learn enough about back-end development to get a job</a> in nine months to two years.</p>
<p>Here’s what you should know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding basics in <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-code-python">Python</a>, Go, or another back-end language</li>
<li><a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-data-structures-python">Data structures</a> and <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-algorithms-python">algorithms</a></li>
<li>The basics of the web, like <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-clients-golang">HTTP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-social-media-backend-golang">Simple web servers</a></li>
<li>Database fundamentals - <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-sql">SQL</a> or NoSQL</li>
<li>How to deploy to the internet</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest, cheapest, most fun and most effective way to learn those six fundamentals is by taking our <a href="https://www.boot.dev/">backend development course</a>. You can also opt to learn backend development by running through these <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/backend/best-backend-projects/">six back-end projects</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-a-backend-developer-earn">
  <span> How much does a backend developer earn?</span> <a href="#how-much-does-a-backend-developer-earn">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Let’s look at a couple of different factors: where you live, what certifications you have, what skills you have, and how good you are in job interviews.</p>
<h3 id="best-cities-for-backend-developer-pay">
  <span> Best cities for backend developer pay</span> <a href="#best-cities-for-backend-developer-pay">🔗</a></h3>
<p>It shouldn’t surprise you to hear that the highest salaries are in California, Massachusetts, and Washington. But before you uproot your life to chase a high backend developer salary, you should look at the cost of living, too.</p>
<p>Here’s a handy chart showing you the takeaways:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.boot.dev/img/800/locationspaybackend.png.webp" alt="Locations for best back-end jobs"/></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AsHkGDEj-Vkf8CSxtHxETFsApp5f7LPf0b3UtBiP1kg/edit?usp=sharing">Best Cities for Backend Developers</a></p>
<p>I looked at the average salary for a backend developer, the median cost of a one-bedroom apartment, the tax rate, and the cost of living in each of the top nine cities.</p>
<h3 id="the-most-in-demand-skills-and-certifications">
  <span> The most in-demand skills and certifications</span> <a href="#the-most-in-demand-skills-and-certifications">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Another important factor in how much backend developers earn is the skills they have. Indeed has a great tool showing the skills that are most often listed in conjunction with a high backend developer salary. Here’s the information you need:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.boot.dev/img/800/skillsforhighersalary.png.webp" alt="Skills that offer a higher salary"/></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AsHkGDEj-Vkf8CSxtHxETFsApp5f7LPf0b3UtBiP1kg/edit?usp=sharing">Best Pay for Backend Developers</a></p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that Indeed’s chart is not flawless. For example, gas chromatography is the skill that boosts your backend developer pay the most (67.5%!)… but before you decide to take a course in it, know that it’s “the process of separating compounds in a mixture by injecting a gaseous or liquid sample into a mobile phase” (thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography#:~:text=Gas%20chromatography%20is%20the%20process,%2C%20argon%2C%20nitrogen%20or%20hydrogen.">Wikipedia</a>) and only three jobs currently posted are asking for it. It’s a very specialized skill that in reality almost no back-end developers are going to truly need.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Python and Go are much more in-demand skills, but they “only” offer a 6-9% increase in backend developer salary. However, you shouldn’t expect to get a job if you can’t code in at least one of these languages, and ideally <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/education/learn-multiple-programming-languages/">several of them</a>. The same could be said for the “computer science” skill – only listed on 90 jobs! But best believe you’ll struggle to get a job as a backend developer if you don’t know computer science.</p>
<p>Use this chart to see which skills you should specialize in, or which to emphasize if you already possess those skills.</p>
<h3 id="the-most-in-demand-soft-skills">
  <span> The most in-demand soft skills</span> <a href="#the-most-in-demand-soft-skills">🔗</a></h3>
<p>It’s a given that soft skills <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1035304616674613">are as important</a> as hard skills to determine how much you earn.</p>
<p>It’s much harder to quantify these skills. Instead of looking specifically at which soft skills increase how much backend developers earn specifically, I investigated which soft skills increase job pay generally, and cross-referenced with the skills I know make backend developers successful.</p>
<p>I looked at one study in particular: the effect of self-reported soft skills on the wages of post-secondary graduates in France. I know there are limitations to this – most of us aren’t post-secondary graduates in France, for one – but it was a great way to measure the effect of soft skills on income.</p>
<p>The study found that grit, risk-taking, communication, and self-esteem all had a role to play in increasing wages:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.boot.dev/img/800/percentingreasebackend.png.webp" alt="Percent increase vs. Skill"/></p>
<p>Surprisingly, the study found that sociability did not show a rise in wages, but the authors speculated this could be because not many people said they <em>weren’t</em> sociable, so there just wasn’t enough data.</p>
<p>I compared that to the estimated wage increase corresponding to an extra level of schooling, which I took from <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1035304616674613">this</a> Czech study.</p>
<p>We can conclude (within the limitations of the studies, and the fact that I’m referencing two different studies with different populations) that grit, self-esteem, and communication are soft skills that are worth more than a whole extra degree. Risk-taking is also, surprisingly, a significant factor in how much backend developers earn.</p>
<p>Finally, we know that scientifically speaking, <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/jobs/confidence-in-job-interviews/">confidence in job interviews</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2010269117">predicts</a> the gender pay gap among STEM graduates. Increasing confidence is therefore a key determinant in your starting salary – and especially important for women and non-binary folks.</p>

  <span> How does the salary stack up compared to other developer/engineer jobs?</span> <a href="#how-does-the-salary-stack-up-compared-to-other-developerengineer-jobs">🔗</a></h2>
<p>If you have a base set of computer science skills and you’re deciding which job to pursue, it can be helpful to know how much backend developers make compared to other, similar roles.</p>
<p>To compare these roles to how much backend developers make, I’ll use the same source for every job: Indeed’s average salary estimate.</p>
<h3 id="front-end-versus-backend-developer">
  <span> Front end versus backend developer</span> <a href="#front-end-versus-backend-developer">🔗</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/backend/learn-frontend-or-backend-first/">difference between frontend and backend developers</a> can be boiled down to client versus server. Indeed reports that this difference amounts to a $3k difference in average annual salary – backend developers can expect to make $95k as mentioned in the intro, while front-end developers will make <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/front-end-developer/salaries?cgtk=c5deb7be-7b7c-41a9-8e1b-3521ff5870ba&amp;from=careeradvice-US">on average</a> $92k.</p>
<p>Why this discrepancy? Apollo Clark, a full-stack developer, <a href="https://qr.ae/pvmgo7">posited</a> a potential answer on Quora. “It’s a cultural bias in software development that the front-end or ‘gui’ is what the ‘graphic artists’ create, while the back-end is where all the complex computer science theory needs to take place, and should never be questioned.”</p>
<h3 id="fullstack-developer-versus-backend-developer">
  <span> Fullstack developer versus backend developer</span> <a href="#fullstack-developer-versus-backend-developer">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Fullstack developers are expected to handle both the front end and the back end. Their pay is therefore higher than just one or the other – Indeed <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/full-stack-developer/salaries?cgtk=c5deb7be-7b7c-41a9-8e1b-3521ff5870ba&amp;from=careeradvice-US">estimates</a> that the average full-stack developer earns $101k per year.</p>
<p>Wondering <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/backend/learn-frontend-or-backend-first/">which to learn first, back end or front end</a>? There are a lot of factors that go into deciding which one is best to start with, but I’d recommend learning backend development first – it pays more, and there’s less competition – and then learning front-end development afterward to become a full-stack developer.</p>
<h3 id="data-engineer-versus-backend-developer">
  <span> Data engineer versus backend developer</span> <a href="#data-engineer-versus-backend-developer">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Data engineers earn $115k per year on average <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/data-engineer/salaries?from=top_sb">according</a> to Indeed. Full-stack development is a key skill to becoming a data engineer, so if this salary appeals to you, I recommend learning backend development, then front end, then tackling data engineering.</p>

<h3 id="data-scientist-versus-backend-developer">
  <span> Data scientist versus backend developer</span> <a href="#data-scientist-versus-backend-developer">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The much-touted sexiest job of the century! The average salary for data scientists is a bit higher than backend developers, clocking in at $100k per year <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career/data-scientist/salaries#salary-satisfaction">according</a> to Indeed.</p>
<p>Like a backend developer, one of the main languages you’ll use in <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/python/python-for-data-science/">data science is Python</a>. Beyond that, there are quite a few differences. You’ll need more business, analysis, and data viz skills to get into a data science career path.</p>

<p>When you think about how much backend developers make, there’s so much more than just a flat number to consider. You need to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where you live, and where you’d be willing to move</li>
<li>What skills you have, and what skills you can gain</li>
<li>How much confidence you have, and whether you can bring that confidence to bear during interviews</li>
</ul>
<p>But overall? Backend developers make a lot of money, relatively speaking. Most enjoy their job. The skills are very flexible, meaning you could grow your career easily. And in the meantime, your job isn’t going anywhere: the demand for backend developers is high, and the supply is low.</p>
