            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>What&#39;s the first thing you do when you find a bug or see a missing feature in an open source project? Check out the project page and submit a patch!</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discourage-oss/send-us-116-pull-requests.png" alt="Send us a pull request! (116 open pull requests)" width="1012" height="152"/></p> <p>Oh. Maybe their message is so encouraging that they get hundreds of pull requests a week, and the backlog isn&#39;t that bad.</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discourage-oss/why-is-this-ignored.png" alt="Multiple people ask why this bug fix is being ignored. No response." width="745" height="472"/></p> <p>Maybe not. Giant sucker than I am, I submitted a pull request even after seeing that. All things considered, I should consider myself lucky that it&#39;s possible to <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/02/wow-remember-when-people-tracked-bugs-welcome-to-the-next-level/">submit pull requests at all</a>. If I&#39;m really lucky, maybe they&#39;ll get around to <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html">looking at it one day</a>.</p>  <p>I don&#39;t mean to pick on this particular project. I can understand how this happens. You&#39;re a dev who can merge pull requests, but you&#39;re not in charge of triaging bugs and pull requests; you have a day job, projects that you own, and a life outside of coding. Maybe you take a look at the repo every once in a while, merge in good pull requests, and make comments on the ones that need more work, but you don&#39;t look at all 116 open pull requests; who has that kind of time?</p> <p>This behavior, eminently reasonable on the part of any individual, results in a systemic failure, a tax on new open source contributors. I often get asked how to get started with open source. It&#39;s easy for me to forget that getting started can be hard because the first projects I contributed to have a response time measured in hours for issues and pull requests. But a lot of people have experiences which aren&#39;t so nice. They contribute a few patches to a couple projects that get ignored, and have no idea where to go from there. It doesn&#39;t take <a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2012/12/14/dear-open-source-project-leader-quit-being-a-jerk/">egregious individual behavior</a> to create a hostile environment.</p> <p>That&#39;s kept me from contributing to some projects. At my last job, I worked on making a well-known open source project production quality, fixing hundreds of bugs over the course of a couple months. When I had some time, I looked into pushing the changes back to the open source community. But when I looked at the mailing list for the project, I saw a wasteland of good patches that were completely ignored, where the submitter would ping the list a couple times and then give up. Did it seem worth spending a week to disentangle our IP from the project in order to submit a set of patches that would, in all likelihood, get ignored? No.</p> <p>If you have commit access to a project that has this problem, please <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility">own the process</a> for incoming pull requests (or don&#39;t ask for pull requests in your repo description). It doesn&#39;t have to permanent; just until you have a system in place. Not only will you get more contributors to your project, you&#39;ll help break down one barrier to becoming an open source contributor.</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discourage-oss/plz-review.png" alt="joewiz replies to an month old comment.
