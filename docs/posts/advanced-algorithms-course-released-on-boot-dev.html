            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
           <p>Sorry it took so long for me to get this one out! <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-algorithms-2-python">Learn Advanced Algorithms</a> was just released, and I’m excited to let you all get your hands on it, even if you’re just auditing it for free! The more advanced material takes quite a bit longer to produce, I wanted to triple-check to make sure I got everything correct and that I’ve presented it in a way that makes it easy to understand.</p>
<p>The course, like its prerequisite, <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-data-structures-python">Learn Data Structures</a>, is written in Python, so most of the algorithms you write will be Python classes. Aside from the Python coding exercises that you can complete in your browser, multiple-choice questions help ensure you’ve digested the reading material. Sometimes the more math-intensive stuff simply can’t be learned easily through code, so you’ve got to do a bit of reading.</p>
<p>While it’s not completely necessary to take my <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-data-structures-python">Learn Data Structures</a> and <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-algorithms-python">Learn Algorithms</a> courses first, I would recommend it, even if you’ve learned this stuff before. It doesn’t cost any extra, and the refresher will really help. I won’t rehash all the Big-O complexity stuff here, because I’m assuming you’re already familiar with it. In this course, we focus on implementing some of the more advanced algorithms that you would learn in a CS undergraduate degree and learn how you can recognize when algorithms of this sort will help you in your future career.</p>
<h2 id="whats-included">
  <span> What’s included?</span> <a href="#whats-included">🔗</a></h2>
<p>There are four modules.</p>
<h3 id="module-1---graph-theory">
  <span> Module 1 - Graph Theory</span> <a href="#module-1---graph-theory">🔗</a></h3>
<p>In this module, we have a brief refresher on graph data structures, and implement some basic traversal algorithms like breadth and depth-first search. We also cover different types of graphs, like complete and directed graphs, and how they can be represented in code.</p>
<h3 id="module-2---advanced-searches">
  <span> Module 2 - Advanced Searches</span> <a href="#module-2---advanced-searches">🔗</a></h3>
<p>In this module, we really round out our experience with graphs. We learn about greedy algorithms, and how they can help us write faster code. We also implement a priority queue so that we can use it as we do a deep dive on Dijkstra’s algorithm. Finally, we finished the module by writing an A* search that can find its way quickly through a muddy map - similar to what you’d need to write as a game developer.</p>
<h3 id="module-3---dynamic-programming">
  <span> Module 3 - Dynamic Programming</span> <a href="#module-3---dynamic-programming">🔗</a></h3>
<p>In this module, we shift gears, and learn about how memoization and tabulation techniques can be used to optimize various algorithms by trading memory for speed. We re-write the classic Fibonacci function using dynamic programming, as well as the super useful edit-distance algorithm. Edit distance is used in the real world to calculate the similarity in spellings between words, just like how spell-checkers work.</p>
<h3 id="module-4---linear-programming">
  <span> Module 4 - Linear Programming</span> <a href="#module-4---linear-programming">🔗</a></h3>
<p>In the final module, we shift course yet again to focus more on the mathematical side of things. Linear programming is a technique used to solve linear systems of equations, specifically optimization problems. We build from scratch a Simplex solver in Python and use it to calculate the exact number of cookies and cakes a baker should produce to maximize the profit in her shop.</p>
