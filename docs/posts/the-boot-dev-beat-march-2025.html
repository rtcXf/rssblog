           <p>Our new JavaScript course is <em>live</em>! ThePrimeagen’s course on building your own HTTP server from scratch is just around the corner, and the TypeScript track couldn’t be closer.</p>

<p>We’ve redone our JavaScript course from scratch. The old one needed so much love, that it wasn’t even worth keeping. We threw it in the trash, and started anew. There are now 15 chapters, and we go pretty in-depth into some of the advanced stuff like the event loop and concurrency, so be prepared!</p>
<ol>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Comparisons</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Objects</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Prototypes</li>
<li>Loops</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Errors</li>
<li>Sets</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Promises</li>
<li>The Event Loop</li>
<li>Runtimes</li>
<li>Modules</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a course <em>for developers</em>, so I only recommend starting it after you’ve done some of our earlier Python courses.</p>

<p>Opening a Boot.dev lesson on your phone is no longer a soul-crushing experience. I mean, there’s only so much we can do about the very real pain of trying to write code on a phone, but at least now you’re not also doing sweet battle with our UI.</p>

<p>Boots is now primarily powered by Anthropic’s <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet">Claude 3.7 Sonnet model</a>, which made even bigger leaps in terms of reasoning and coding capabilities. Betters AI mentorship is better, so we hope you enjoy!</p>

  <span> 4. We acquired iCodeThis and are making it free</span> <a href="#4-we-acquired-icodethis-and-are-making-it-free">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Boot.dev acquired Florin’s <a href="https://icodethis.com/">iCodeThis</a> website this month! We’re still figuring out exactly what projects we want to tackle with it, but what we know for sure is that we’re opening it up for free. So, if you want to practice your CSS and frontend skills, be sure to check it out!</p>
<p><em>We haven’t quite finished stripping out all the paywall logic, but it should be done any day now</em>.</p>

<li>You can now leave ratings and reviews on courses when you finish them, and the ratings are shown on the course landing pages</li>
