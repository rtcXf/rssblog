            <p>I&#8217;m fascinated by the intersection of product and politics. The way media influence our society, the way gig platforms and piece work influence our economy and the stability of our political system, the way social cohesion erodes as the internet takes over our minds.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been working in tech for 22 years. Billions of people around the world use things I&#8217;ve built. I&#8217;ve worked in banking, social media, food delivery, internet privacy, online video, venture capital and more. I used to blog prolifically and I&#8217;ve worked in a broad range of roles. And the entire time I&#8217;ve been fascinated by it all. </p><p>I&#8217;m going to use this platform to write with passion about the things I believe and the things I want to understand better. I hope that you&#8217;ll read it, and I hope you&#8217;ll join in the conversation too. </p><p>Sign up now so you don&#8217;t miss any issues.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://mikehudack.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://mikehudack.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>
