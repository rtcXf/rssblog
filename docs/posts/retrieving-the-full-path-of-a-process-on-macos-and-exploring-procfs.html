<h3 id="the-proc-filesystem-in-linux">The /proc filesystem in Linux</h3>
<p>In “Linux land”, there’s this thing called “procfs”.</p>
<p>It’s a virtual filesystem - in the sense that there are no real regular files in your disk that map to the filesystem representation - that allows a user (in userspace) to perform some introspection about its current running process and others as well.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt">the kernel docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The proc file system acts as an interface to internal data structures in the kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It  can  be  used to obtain information about the system and to change certain kernel parameters at runtime (<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/sysctl">sysctl</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way the interaction with it is set up is pretty nifty:</p>
<ul>
<li>each process receives a given path under <code>/proc</code> (like, <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;</code>), and then</li>
<li>as subdirectories of this path, various other files and subdirectories are present to allow deeper introspection about the specific pid.</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Display the files and directories present at the</span>
<span># very root of `/proc`.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Here we can find the list of PIDs that we can access,</span>
<span># as well as some more system-wide information and </span>
<span># settings that we can tweak.</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Not only that, <code>procfs</code> is very helpful when you’re not sure if a process is blocked on something you didn’t expect (like a <code>write(2)</code> to an <code>nfs</code> mount point that is malformed due to a bad set of servers not responding), or something simple as your process sleeping when you didn’t want to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Sleep for 33 days on the background</span>
sleep 33d <span>&amp;</span>
<span>[</span>1<span>]</span> <span>2786</span>


<span># Check what&#39;s the state of the process</span>
cat /proc/2786/stat
<span>2786</span> <span>(</span>sleep<span>)</span> S ...
 <span>|</span>     <span>|</span>     <span>|</span>

 <span>|</span>     <span>`</span>-&gt; <span>command</span> being run <span>(</span>sleep <span>command</span><span>)</span>
 <span>`</span>-&gt; process id <span>(</span>the pid we used before<span>)</span>


<span># Check what&#39;s the stack trace (from the kernel</span>
<span># perspective) that led the process to this </span>
<span># sleep state</span>

<span>[</span>&lt;0&gt;<span>]</span> entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x3d/0xa2
<span>[</span>&lt;0&gt;<span>]</span> 0xffffffffffffffff
</code></pre></div><h3 id="procfs-under-the-hood">procfs under the hood</h3>
<p>What’s interesting about being virtual is that the implementation of <code>procfs</code> is able to generate the representation of the filesystem on the fly - whenever you issue an I/O call like <code>read(2)</code>, Linux answers back with what you asked for, be it the list of file descriptors opened by a given process, or the list of environment variables that were set at process startup time.</p>
<p>For instance, if tracing the execution of <code>cat /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/meminfo</code> down, we can find the path that the <code>read(2)</code> syscall takes:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># stack trace of `cat /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/meminfo`</span>
        meminfo_proc_show
        proc_reg_read
        __vfs_read
        vfs_read
        sys_read
        do_syscall_64
        entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe


<span># stack trace of `cat /file.txt` </span>
<span># on an ext4 mount point</span>
        ext4_file_read_iter
        __vfs_read
        vfs_read
        sys_read
        do_syscall_64
        entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe
</code></pre></div><p>Very different from a regular <code>read</code> (as shown in the second stack trace), there’s no real file on disk being accessed - just <code>meminfo_proc_show</code> returning the contents related to what the user asked for: virtual memory stuff.</p>
<p>By the way, if you’re interested in knowing more about related subjects, a <strong>great</strong> reference for this type of knowledge is <a href="https://amzn.to/2QWyXp9">The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook</a>.</p>
<p>Now to MacOS.</p>
<h3 id="the-libproc-library-in-macos">The libproc library in MacOS</h3>
<p>Differently from Linux, it feels like we can’t know all that much about how things work on MacOS.</p>
<p>After searching a bit on how to accomplish how to gather information about a process, <code>libproc</code> showed up.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2422.1.72/libsyscall/wrappers/libproc/libproc.h.auto.html"><code>libproc.h</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>/*
</span><span> * This header file contains private interfaces 
</span><span> * to obtain process information.
</span><span> *
</span><span> * These interfaces are subject to change in future releases.
</span><span> */</span>
</code></pre></div><p>One thing to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>the interfaces are <strong>private</strong> - no guaranteed compatibility with future releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>This has been elucidated by an Apple staff member on <a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/46963">post</a> at the Apple’s developer forum regarding gathering process information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] Apple has not put a lot of effort into providing APIs for getting this sort of information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What APIs that do exist were either inherited from OS X’s predecessor OSs or were added <strong>primarily to meet our internal requirements rather than the needs for third-party developers</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, you will find a lot of places where these APIs are: incomplete; incorrect; poorly documented and aren’t as binary compatible as they should be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, we can still make use of it - more specifically, we can make use of <code>proc_pidpath</code>, a method that takes a <code>pid</code> (the <code>pid</code> of the process that we want to know more about), a buffer where the path should be written to, and the buffer size.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>int</span> <span>proc_pidpath</span><span>(</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>pid</span><span>,</span>              <span>// pid of the process to know more about
</span><span></span>  <span>void</span> <span>*</span> <span>buffer</span><span>,</span>        <span>// buffer to fill with the abs path
</span><span></span>  <span>uint32_t</span>  <span>buffersize</span>  <span>// size of the buffer
</span><span></span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That said, we can go ahead and create our Go binary that can handle both Linux and MacOS by specifying two different compilation targets.</p>
<h3 id="a-golang-binary-that-suits-linux-and-macos">A Golang binary that suits Linux and MacOS</h3>
<p>Given that <code>libproc</code> will not be a thing under Linux, we can start by creating a <code>pidpath_linux.go</code> file that is meant to be compiled only on Linux, and another file, <code>pidpath_darwin.go</code>, aimed at MacOS machines.</p>
<p>The Linux one is rather simple: it follows the <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/exe</code> symlink, and that’s it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// +build linux
</span><span></span><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>&#34;os&#34;</span>
	<span>&#34;strconv&#34;</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>GetExePathFromPid</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>path</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>return</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The MacOS version though, needs a little bit more.</p>
<p>Given that we’d access <code>libproc</code> via C, we can leverage <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/">CGO</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>// +build darwin

<p>It was interesting to me to check out how different things are in MacOS land.</p>
<p>Although I use a Macbook Pro as a personal computer (and a Mac at work), I’ve not really paid attention to these little details.</p>
<p>Also, <code>/proc</code> is just <strong>so</strong> valuable! Definitely worth knowing more about other functionality over there. Make sure you check out <a href="https://amzn.to/2QWyXp9">The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook</a>.</p>
