      <p>I don’t know how many people are still reading my Turtle and Koala stories. Those of you who do can rest assured that they will keep coming, though, and that I have no intention to stop making this blog a friendlier place by writing about the tiny exploits of my two favorite characters.</p>
<p>Today I want to introduce you to a moore frequently updated alternative to my <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/koala-and-turtle">backlog of stories</a>: my fiancée and I have been sharing little vignettes of the odd couple for a long time, and she finally found the time and energy to <a href="http://turtle-and-koala.tumblr.com/">put some of hers online</a>. Her writing is somewhat different from mine—objectively better, as I maintain—, and you might enjoy that breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Give it a try and do tell us what you think!</p>
