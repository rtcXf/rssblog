           <p>You‚Äôve probably visited a site and attempted to sign-up only to be met with errors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Password needs a capital letter</li>
<li>Password needs a special character</li>
<li>Password needs to be at least 8 characters</li>
</ul>
<p>I just released a package in Go that solves this problem. Check it out and give it a star here: <a href="https://github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-password-validator">go-password-validator</a>. If you want to understand how it works, and how to properly validate user passwords, read on.</p>
<p>Not only are the rules above quite annoying, but they can also be a security <em>flaw</em> in the system. Take for example a strong passphrase: <code>super worm eaten human trike</code>. That passphrase has plenty of entropy (randomness) but it wouldn‚Äôt pass the first two validation steps given above. <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">XKCD</a> puts this best:</p>

  <span> The Problem - Allow Users to Use Any Password Format as Long as It Has Enough Entropy</span> <a href="#the-problem---allow-users-to-use-any-password-format-as-long-as-it-has-enough-entropy">üîó</a></h2>
<p>We don‚Äôt care if a password only has lowercase letters if it‚Äôs long. All that matters is the <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/what-is-entropy-in-cryptography/">entropy</a>. Entropy in this context refers to the number of brute-force guesses it would take to guess a password, and we measure it in bits (the exponent in <code>2^n</code>). Refer to the following chart to see how various entropy levels contribute to the time it takes to brute force a password.</p>

<p>The way <a href="https://github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-password-validator">go-password-validator</a> works is my favorite (obviously, I wrote it), but there is certainly room for improvement. Let‚Äôs take a look at the process. From its <a href="https://github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-password-validator#how-it-works">Readme</a>:</p>
<p>First, we determine the ‚Äúbase‚Äù number. The base is a sum of the different ‚Äúcharacter sets‚Äù found in the password.</p>
<p>The current character sets include:</p>
<ul>
<li>26 lowercase letters</li>
<li>26 uppercase</li>
<li>10 digits</li>
<li>32 special characters - <code>!&#34;#$%&amp;&#39;()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_{|}~</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Using at least one character from each set your base number will be <code>94: 26+26+10+32 = 94</code></p>
<p>Every unique character that doesn‚Äôt match one of those sets will add <code>1</code> to the base.</p>
<p>If you only use, for example, lowercase letters and numbers, your base will be <code>36: 26+10 = 36</code>.</p>
<p>After we have calculated a base, the total number of brute-force-guesses is found using the following formulae: <code>base^length</code></p>
<p>A password using base 26 with 7 characters would require <code>26^7</code>, or <code>8031810176</code> guesses.</p>
<p>Once we know the number of guesses it would take, we can calculate the actual entropy in bits using <code>log2(guesses)</code></p>
