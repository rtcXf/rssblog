        <h1>Should you Learn Computer Science or Software Engineering?</h1>
        <section>
            
            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
           <p>The most important thing to understand about these two fields of study is that, ultimately, they are similar. At the end of the day, Software Engineering and Computer Science will both help to make you a better programmer and developer, and the only difference between the two is how they are applied. Software Engineering tends to be more practical, and Computer Science tends to be more theoretical. In a way, Software Engineering is just applied Computer Science, and using that as a starting point, we can examine the differences between the two.</p>
<h2 id="the-differences">
  <span> The Differences</span> <a href="#the-differences">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Software Engineering is the study of how software systems are built. While studying and practicing Software Engineering, there is a distinct focus on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application development</li>
<li>Project management</li>
<li>Quality assurance</li>
<li>Software testing and maintenance</li>
<li>Clean code and clean architecture</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Continuous integration and continuous deployment</li>
</ul>
<p>By contrast, Computer Science tends to have a less practical and more theoretical approach to its study. The study of Computer Science can include (but is not necessarily limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial intelligence</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>
<li>Cryptography</li>
<li>Graphic development</li>
<li>Algorithms and data structures</li>
<li>Quantum computing</li>
<li>Distributed consensus</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, Software Engineering has an obvious focus, while Computer Science can be viewed as a more renaissance study of theoretical computer applications.</p>
<h2 id="the-overlap">
  <span> The Overlap</span> <a href="#the-overlap">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Of course, while there are plenty of differences between Computer Science and Software Engineering, there are many more similarities. As Software Engineering is basically just an applied form of Computer Science, it stands to reason that understanding both enhances the understanding of either. Any Computer Scientist benefits from understanding the practical applications of their craft - in the form of software development, technology management, and the result of programming.</p>
<p>By that same token, <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/computer-science/why-learn-computer-science/">Software Engineers that have a deep understanding of Computer Science</a> principles tend to command a higher salary and are able to solve more technically challenging problems.</p>
<p>As for actually attending school for both Software Engineering and Computer Science, there is actually a great deal of overlap between the two as far as classwork is concerned. In fact, it would easily be possible to begin down the path of one and, having changed your mind, start down the path of another.</p>
<h2 id="class-requirement-comparison">
  <span> Class Requirement Comparison</span> <a href="#class-requirement-comparison">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Because smaller colleges often provide more insight into a ‚Äústandard‚Äù course load, let‚Äôs compare the differences and similarities between a Software Development (Software Engineering) degree and a Computer Science degree from Dixie State University, a mid-size college in southern Utah.</p>

<p>As you can see, there is a great deal of overlap in course load between the two disciplines.</p>
<p>The main difference between a <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/computer-science/guide-to-certificate-in-computer-science/">computer science degree or certificate</a> and a software engineering education is that computer science requires more high-level math and science classes, while the software engineering route includes more applied classes such as Unix/Linux and Web Design. If you can stick it out, most employers generally prefer a candidate with a computer science background, as software engineering principles can more easily be learned on the job.</p>
<h2 id="titles-and-salaries">
  <span> Titles and Salaries</span> <a href="#titles-and-salaries">üîó</a></h2>
<p>When it comes right down to it, the job titles of ‚Äú<a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Software-Engineer-Salary">Software Engineer</a>‚Äù and ‚Äú<a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Computer-Scientist-Salary">Computer Scientist</a>‚Äù make comparable money with Software Engineers averaging $100,000/yr and Computer Scientists averaging $102,000/yr, at least in the United States. However, it‚Äôs important to note that the job titles don‚Äôt necessarily match the skillsets of the individuals performing them. Many software engineers, especially the highly-paid ones have also studied Computer Science, and it‚Äôs almost impossible to find a computer scientist who isn‚Äôt well-versed in the best software engineering practices. For a full list of CS salary breakdowns by job title, we have a <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/computer-science/highest-paying-computer-science-jobs/">separate article that goes into the details</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Software Engineers, being of a more practical variety of skilled laborers, are more likely to come into increasingly high demand as technology continues to move forward. In practice, both Computer Science and Software Engineering are excellent fields to enter if one has a love of computers, coding, and mathematics. The best part is, you don‚Äôt even need to go to a university, you can <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/computer-science/comprehensive-guide-to-learn-computer-science-online/">learn both computer science and software engineering completely online</a>.</p>
