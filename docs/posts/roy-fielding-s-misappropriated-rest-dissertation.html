        <h1>Roy Fielding’s Misappropriated REST Dissertation</h1>
        <section>
            
            <p>RESTful APIs are everywhere. This is funny, because how many people really know
what “RESTful” is supposed to mean?</p>

<p>I think most of us can empathize with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7201871">this Hacker News
poster</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve read several articles about REST, even a bit of the original paper. But
I still have quite a vague idea about what it is. I’m beginning to think that
nobody knows, that it’s simply a very poorly defined concept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had planned to write a blog post exploring how REST came to be such a
dominant paradigm for communication across the internet. I started my research
by reading <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation_2up.pdf">Roy Fielding’s 2000
dissertation</a>,
which introduced REST to the world. After reading Fielding’s dissertation, I
realized that the much more interesting story here is how Fielding’s ideas came
to be so widely misunderstood. <!--more--></p>

<p>Many more people know that Fielding’s dissertation is where REST came from than
have read the dissertation (fair enough), so misconceptions about what the
dissertation actually contains are pervasive.</p>

<p>The biggest of these misconceptions is that the dissertation directly addresses
the problem of building APIs. I had always assumed, as I imagine many people
do, that REST was intended from the get-go as an architectural model for web
APIs built on top of HTTP. I thought perhaps that there had been some chaotic
experimental period where people were building APIs on top of HTTP all wrong,
and then Fielding came along and presented REST as the sane way to do things.
But the timeline doesn’t make sense here: APIs for web services, in the sense
that we know them today, weren’t a thing until a few years after Fielding
published his dissertation.</p>

<p>Fielding’s dissertation (titled “Architectural Styles and the Design of
Network-based Software Architectures”) is not about how to build APIs on top of
HTTP but rather about HTTP itself. Fielding contributed to the HTTP/1.0
specification and co-authored the HTTP/1.1 specification, which was published
in 1999. He was interested in the architectural lessons that could be drawn
from the design of the HTTP protocol; his dissertation presents REST as a
distillation of the architectural principles that guided the standardization
process for HTTP/1.1. Fielding used these principles to make decisions about
which proposals to incorporate into HTTP/1.1. For example, he rejected a
proposal to batch requests using new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MGET</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MHEAD</code> methods because he felt
the proposal violated the constraints prescribed by REST, especially the
constraint that messages in a REST system should be easy to proxy and
cache.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html/#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> So HTTP/1.1 was instead designed around persistent connections over
which multiple HTTP requests can be sent. (Fielding also felt that cookies are
not RESTful because they add state to what should be a stateless system, but
their usage was already entrenched.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html/#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>) REST, for Fielding, was not a guide to
building HTTP-based systems but a guide to extending HTTP.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that Fielding doesn’t think REST could be used to build other
systems. It’s just that he assumes these other systems will also be
“distributed hypermedia systems.” This is another misconception people have
about REST: that it is a general architecture you can use for any kind of
networked application. But you could sum up the part of the dissertation where
Fielding introduces REST as, essentially, “Listen, we just designed HTTP, so if
you also find yourself designing a <em>distributed hypermedia system</em> you should
use this cool architecture we worked out called REST to make things easier.”
It’s not obvious why Fielding thinks anyone would ever attempt to build such a
thing given that the web already exists; perhaps in 2000 it seemed like there
was room for more than one distributed hypermedia system in the world. Anyway,
Fielding makes clear that REST is intended as a solution for the scalability
and consistency problems that arise when trying to connect hypermedia across
the internet, <em>not</em> as an architectural model for distributed applications in
general.</p>

<p>We remember Fielding’s dissertation now as the dissertation that introduced
REST, but really the dissertation is about how much one-size-fits-all software
architectures suck, and how you can better pick a software architecture
appropriate for your needs. Only a single chapter of the dissertation is
devoted to REST itself; much of the word count is spent on a taxonomy of
alternative architectural styles<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html/#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> that one could use for networked
applications. Among these is the Pipe-and-Filter (PF) style, inspired by Unix
pipes, along with various refinements of the Client-Server style (CS), such as
Layered-Client-Server (LCS), Client-Cache-Stateless-Server (C$SS), and
Layered-Client-Cache-Stateless-Server (LC$SS). The acronyms get unwieldy but
Fielding’s point is that you can mix and match constraints imposed by existing
styles to derive new styles. REST gets derived this way and could instead have
been called—but for obvious reasons was
not—Uniform-Layered-Code-on-Demand-Client-Cache-Stateless-Server (ULCODC$SS).
Fielding establishes this taxonomy to emphasize that different constraints are
appropriate for different applications and that this last group of constraints
were the ones he felt worked best for HTTP.</p>

<p>This is the deep, deep irony of REST’s ubiquity today. REST gets blindly used
for all sorts of networked applications now, but Fielding originally offered
REST as an illustration of how to derive a software architecture tailored to
an individual application’s particular needs.</p>

<p>I struggle to understand how this happened, because Fielding is so explicit
about the pitfalls of not letting form follow function. He warns, almost at the
very beginning of the dissertation, that “design-by-buzzword is a common
occurrence” brought on by a failure to properly appreciate software
architecture.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html/#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> He picks up this theme again several pages later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some architectural styles are often portrayed as “silver bullet” solutions
for all forms of software. However, a good designer should select a style
that matches the needs of a particular problem being solved.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html/#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>REST itself is an especially poor “silver bullet” solution, because, as
Fielding later points out, it incorporates trade-offs that may not be
appropriate unless you are building a distributed hypermedia application:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>REST is designed to be efficient for large-grain hypermedia data transfer,
optimizing for the common case of the Web, but resulting in an interface that
is not optimal for other forms of architectural interaction.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html/#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fielding came up with REST because the web posed a thorny problem of “anarchic
scalability,” by which Fielding means the need to connect documents in a
performant way across organizational and national boundaries. The constraints
that REST imposes were carefully chosen to solve this anarchic scalability
problem. Web service APIs that are <em>public-facing</em> have to deal with a similar
problem, so one can see why REST is relevant there. Yet today it would not be
at all surprising to find that an engineering team has built a backend using
REST even though the backend only talks to clients that the engineering team
has full control over. We have all become the architect in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNoPJqm3DAY">this Monty Python
sketch</a>, who designs an apartment
building in the style of a slaughterhouse because slaughterhouses are the only
thing he has experience building. (Fielding uses a line from this sketch as an
epigraph for his dissertation: “Excuse me… did you say ‘knives’?”)</p>

<p>So, given that Fielding’s dissertation was all about avoiding silver bullet
software architectures, how did REST become a de facto standard for web
services of every kind?</p>

<p>My theory is that, in the mid-2000s, the people who were sick of SOAP and
wanted to do something else needed their own four-letter acronym.</p>

<p>I’m only half-joking here. SOAP, or the Simple Object Access Protocol, is a
verbose and complicated protocol that you cannot use without first
understanding a bunch of interrelated XML specifications. Early web services
offered APIs based on SOAP, but, as more and more APIs started being offered in
the mid-2000s, software developers burned by SOAP’s complexity migrated away en
masse.</p>

<p>Among this crowd, SOAP inspired contempt. Ruby-on-Rails
dropped SOAP support in 2007, leading to this emblematic comment from Rails
creator David Heinemeier Hansson: “We feel that SOAP is overly complicated.
It’s been taken over by the enterprise people, and when that happens, usually
nothing good comes of it.”<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html/#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> The “enterprise people” wanted everything to be
formally specified, but the get-shit-done crowd saw that as a waste of time.</p>

<p>If the get-shit-done crowd wasn’t going to use SOAP, they still needed some
standard way of doing things. Since everyone was using HTTP, and since
everyone would keep using HTTP at least as a transport layer because of all the
proxying and caching support, the simplest possible thing to do was just rely
on HTTP’s existing semantics. So that’s what they did. They could have called
their approach Fuck It, Overload HTTP (FIOH), and that would have been an
accurate name, as anyone who has ever tried to decide what HTTP status code to
return for a business logic error can attest. But that would have seemed
recklessly blasé next to all the formal specification work that went into SOAP.</p>

<p>Luckily, there was this dissertation out there, written by a co-author of the
HTTP/1.1 specification, that had something vaguely to do with extending HTTP
and could offer FIOH a veneer of academic respectability. So REST was
appropriated to give cover for what was really just FIOH.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that this is exactly how things happened, or that there was an
actual conspiracy among irreverent startup types to misappropriate REST, but
this story helps me understand how REST became a model for web service APIs
when Fielding’s dissertation isn’t about web service APIs at all. Adopting
REST’s constraints makes some sense, especially for public-facing APIs that do
cross organizational boundaries and thus benefit from REST’s “uniform
interface.” That link must have been the kernel of why REST first got mentioned
in connection with building APIs on the web. But imagining a separate approach
called “FIOH,” that borrowed the “REST” name partly just for marketing reasons,
helps me account for the many disparities between what today we know as RESTful
APIs and the REST architectural style that Fielding originally described.</p>

<p>REST purists often complain, for example, that so-called REST APIs aren’t
actually REST APIs because they do not use Hypermedia as The Engine of
Application State (HATEOAS). Fielding himself <a href="https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">has made this
criticism</a>.
According to him, a real REST API is supposed to allow you to navigate all its
endpoints from a base endpoint by following links. If you think that people are
actually out there trying to build REST APIs, then this is a glaring
omission—HATEOAS really is fundamental to Fielding’s original conception of
REST, especially considering that the “state transfer” in “Representational
State Transfer” refers to navigating a state machine using hyperlinks between
resources (and not, as many people seem to believe, to transferring resource
state over the wire).<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/06/28/rest.html/#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> But if you imagine that everyone is just building
FIOH APIs and advertising them, with a nudge and a wink, as REST APIs, or
slightly more honestly as “RESTful” APIs, then of course HATEOAS is
unimportant.</p>

<p>Similarly, you might be surprised to know that there is nothing in Fielding’s
dissertation about which HTTP verb should map to which CRUD action, even though
software developers like to argue endlessly about whether using PUT or PATCH to
update a resource is more RESTful. Having a standard mapping of HTTP verbs to
CRUD actions is a useful thing, but this standard mapping is part of FIOH and
not part of REST.</p>

<p>This is why, rather than saying that nobody understands REST, we should just
think of the term “REST” as having been misappropriated. The modern notion of a
REST API has historical links to Fielding’s REST architecture, but really the
two things are separate. The historical link is good to keep in mind as a guide
for when to build a RESTful API. Does your API cross organizational and
national boundaries the same way that HTTP needs to? Then building a RESTful
API with a predictable, uniform interface might be the right approach. If not,
it’s good to remember that Fielding favored having form follow function. Maybe
something like GraphQL or even just JSON-RPC would be a better fit for what you
are trying to accomplish.</p>
