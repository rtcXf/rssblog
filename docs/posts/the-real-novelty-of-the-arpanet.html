        <h1>The Real Novelty of the ARPANET</h1>
        <section>
            
            <p>If you run an image search for the word “ARPANET,” you will find lots of maps
showing how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">government research
network</a> expanded steadily across the
country throughout the late ’60s and early ’70s. I’m guessing that most people
reading or hearing about the ARPANET for the first time encounter one of these
maps.</p>

<p>Obviously, the maps are interesting—it’s hard to believe that there were once
so few networked computers that their locations could all be conveyed with what
is really pretty lo-fi cartography. (We’re talking 1960s overhead projector
diagrams here. You know the vibe.) But the problem with the maps, drawn as they
are with bold lines stretching across the continent, is that they reinforce the
idea that the ARPANET’s paramount achievement was connecting computers across
the vast distances of the United States for the first time.

<p>Today, the internet is a lifeline that keeps us tethered to each other even as
an airborne virus has us all locked up indoors. So it’s easy to imagine that,
if the ARPANET was the first draft of the internet, then surely the world that
existed before it was entirely disconnected, since that’s where we’d be without
the internet today, right? The ARPANET must have been a big deal because it
connected people via computers when that hadn’t before been possible.</p>

<p>That view doesn’t get the history quite right. It also undersells what made the
ARPANET such a breakthrough.</p>

<h2 id="the-debut">The Debut</h2>
<p>The Washington Hilton stands near the top of a small rise about a mile and a
half northeast of the National Mall. Its two white-painted modern facades sweep
out in broad semicircles like the wings of a bird. The New York Times,
reporting on the hotel’s completion in 1965, remarked that the building looks
“like a sea gull perched on a hilltop nest.”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The hotel hides its most famous feature below ground. Underneath the driveway
roundabout is an enormous ovoid event space known as the International
Ballroom, which was for many years the largest pillar-less ballroom in DC. In
1967, the Doors played a concert there. In 1968, Jimi Hendrix also played a
concert there. In 1972, a somewhat more sedate act took over the ballroom to
put on the inaugural International Conference on Computing Communication, where
a promising research project known as the ARPANET was demonstrated publicly for
the first time.</p>

<p>The 1972 ICCC, which took place from October 24th to 26th, was attended by
about 800 people.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> It brought together all of the leading researchers in the
nascent field of computer networking. According to internet pioneer Bob Kahn,
“if somebody had dropped a bomb on the Washington Hilton, it would have
destroyed almost all of the networking community in the US at that point.”<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Not all of the attendees were computer scientists, however. An advertisement
for the conference claimed it would be “user-focused” and geared toward
“lawyers, medical men, economists, and government men as well as engineers and
communicators.”<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Some of the conference’s sessions were highly technical,
such as the session titled “Data Network Design Problems I” and its sequel
session, “Data Network Design Problems II.” But most of the sessions were, as
promised, focused on the potential social and economic impacts of computer
networking. One session, eerily prescient today, sought to foster a discussion
about how the legal system could act proactively “to safeguard the right of
privacy in the computer data bank.”<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The ARPANET demonstration was intended as a side attraction of sorts for the
attendees. Between sessions, which were held either in the International
Ballroom or elsewhere on the lower level of the hotel, attendees were free to
wander into the Georgetown Ballroom (a smaller ballroom/conference room down
the hall from the big one),<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> where there were 40 terminals from a variety of
manufacturers set up to access the ARPANET.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> These terminals were dumb
terminals—they only handled input and output and could do no computation on
their own. (In fact, in 1972, it’s likely that all of these terminals were
hardcopy terminals, i.e. teletype machines.) The terminals were all hooked up
to a computer known as a Terminal Interface Message Processor or TIP, which sat
on a raised platform in the middle of the room. The TIP was a kind of archaic
router specially designed to connect dumb terminals to the ARPANET. Using the
terminals and the TIP, the ICCC attendees could experiment with logging on and
accessing some of the computers at the 29 host sites then comprising the
ARPANET.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>To exhibit the network’s capabilities, researchers at the host sites across
the country had collaborated to prepare 19 simple “scenarios” for users to
experiment with. These scenarios were compiled into <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2019/07/102784024-05-001-acc.pdf">a
booklet</a>
that was handed to conference attendees as they tentatively approached the maze
of wiring and terminals.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> The scenarios were meant to prove that the
new technology worked but also that it was useful, because so far the ARPANET
was “a highway system without cars,” and its Pentagon funders hoped that a
public demonstration would excite more interest in the network.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p>

<p>The scenarios thus showed off a diverse selection of the software that could be
accessed over the ARPANET: There were programming language interpreters, one
for a Lisp-based language at MIT and another for a numerical computing
environment called Speakeasy hosted at UCLA; there were games, including a
chess program and an implementation of Conway’s Game of Life; and—perhaps most
popular among the conference attendees—there were several AI chat programs,
including the famous ELIZA chat program developed at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum.</p>

<p>The researchers who had prepared the scenarios were careful to list each
command that users were expected to enter at their terminals. This was
especially important because the sequence of commands used to connect to any
given ARPANET host could vary depending on the host in question. To experiment
with the AI chess program hosted on the MIT Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory’s PDP-10 minicomputer, for instance, conference attendees were
instructed to enter the following:</p>

<p><em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[LF]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[SP]</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[CR]</code> below stand for the line feed, space,
and carriage return keys respectively. I’ve explained each command after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">//</code>,
but this syntax was not used for the annotations in the original.</em></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@r [LF]                   // Reset the TIP
@e [SP] r [LF]            // &#34;Echo remote&#34; setting, host echoes characters rather than TIP
@L [SP] 134 [LF]          // Connect to host number 134
:login [SP] iccXXX [CR]   // Login to the MIT AI Lab&#39;s system, where &#34;XXX&#34; should be user&#39;s initials
:chess [CR]               // Start chess program
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If conference attendees were successfully able to enter those commands, their
reward was the opportunity to play around with some of the most cutting-edge
chess software available at the time, where the layout of the board was
represented like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>BR BN BB BQ BK BB BN BR
BP BP BP BP ** BP BP BP
-- ** -- ** -- ** -- **
** -- ** -- BP -- ** --
-- ** -- ** WP ** -- **
** -- ** -- ** -- ** --
WP WP WP WP -- WP WP WP
WR WN WB WQ WK WB WN WR
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In contrast, to connect to UCLA’s IBM System/360 and run the Speakeasy
numerical computing environment, conference attendees had to enter the
following:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@r [LF]                   // Reset the TIP
@t [SP] o [SP] L [LF]     // &#34;Transmit on line feed&#34; setting
@i [SP] L [LF]            // &#34;Insert line feed&#34; setting, i.e. send line feed with each carriage return
@L [SP] 65 [LF]           // Connect to host number 65
tso                       // Connect to IBM Time-Sharing Option system
logon [SP] icX [CR]       // Log in with username, where &#34;X&#34; should be a freely chosen digit
iccc [CR]                 // This is the password (so secure!)
speakez [CR]              // Start Speakeasy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Successfully running that gauntlet gave attendees the power to multiply and
transpose and do other operations on matrices as quickly as they could input
them at their terminal:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>:+! a=m*transpose(m);a [CR]
:+! eigenvals(a) [CR]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Many of the attendees were impressed by the demonstration, but not for the
reasons that we, from our present-day vantage point, might assume. The key
piece of context hard to keep in mind today is that, in 1972, being
able to use a computer remotely, even from a different city, was not new.
Teletype devices had been used to talk to distant computers for decades
already. Almost a full five years before the ICCC, Bill Gates was in a Seattle
high school using a teletype to run his first BASIC programs on a General
Electric computer housed elsewhere in the city. Merely logging in to a host
computer and running a few commands or playing a text-based game was routine.
The software on display here was pretty neat, but the two scenarios I’ve told
you about so far could ostensibly have been experienced without going over the
ARPANET.</p>

<p>Of course, something new was happening under the hood. The lawyers,
policy-makers, and economists at the ICCC might have been enamored with the
clever chess program and the chat bots, but the networking experts would have
been more interested in two other scenarios that did a better job of
demonstrating what the ARPANET project had achieved.</p>

<p>The first of these scenarios involved a program called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NETWRK</code> running on
MIT’s ITS operating system. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NETWRK</code> command was the entrypoint for several
subcommands that could report various aspects of the ARPANET’s operating
status. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SURVEY</code> subcommand reported which hosts on the network were
functioning and available (they all fit on a single list), while the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SUMMARY.OF.SURVEY</code> subcommand aggregated the results of past <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SURVEY</code> runs to
report an “up percentage” for each host as well as how long, on average, it
took for each host to respond to messages. The output of the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SUMMARY.OF.SURVEY</code> subcommand was a table that looked like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>--HOST--  -#-  -%-UP-  -RESP-
UCLA-NMC  001  097%    00.80
SRI-ARC   002  068%    01.23
UCSB-75   003  059%    00.63
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The host number field, as you can see, has room for no more than three digits
(ha!). Other <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NETWRK</code> subcommands allowed users to look at summary of survey
results over a longer historical period or to examine the log of survey results
for a single host.</p>

<p>The second of these scenarios featured a piece of software called the SRI-ARC
Online System being developed at Stanford. This was a fancy piece of software
with lots of functionality (it was the software system that Douglas Engelbart
demoed in the “Mother of All Demos”), but one of the many things it could do
was make use of what was essentially a file hosting service run on the host at
UC Santa Barbara. From a terminal at the Washington Hilton, conference
attendees could copy a file created at Stanford onto the host at UCSB simply by
running a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">copy</code> command and answering a few of the computer’s questions:</p>

<p><em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[ESC]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[SP]</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[CR]</code> below stand for the escape, space, and carriage
return keys respectively. The words in parentheses are prompts printed by the
computer. The escape key is used to autocomplete the filename on the third
line. The file being copied here is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;system&gt;sample.txt;1</code>, where the
trailing one indicates the file’s version number and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;system&gt;</code> indicates the
directory. This was a convention for filenames used by the TENEX operating
system.</em><sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@copy
(TO/FROM UCSB) to
(FILE) &lt;system&gt;sample [ESC] .TXT;1 [CR]
(CREATE/REPLACE) create
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These two scenarios might not look all that different from the first two, but
they were remarkable. They were remarkable because they made it clear that, on
the ARPANET, humans could talk to computers but computers could also talk to
<em>each other.</em> The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SURVEY</code> results collected at MIT weren’t collected by a
human regularly logging in to each machine to check if it was up—they were
collected by a program that knew how to talk to the other machines on the
network. Likewise, the file transfer from Stanford to UCSB didn’t involve any
humans sitting at terminals at either Stanford or UCSB—the user at a terminal
in Washington DC was able to get the two computers to talk each other merely by
invoking a piece of software. Even more, it didn’t matter which of the 40
terminals in the Ballroom you were sitting at, because you could view the MIT
network monitoring statistics or store files at UCSB using any of the terminals
with almost the same sequence of commands.</p>

<p>This is what was totally new about the ARPANET. The ICCC demonstration didn’t
just involve a human communicating with a distant computer. It wasn’t just a
demonstration of remote I/O. It was a demonstration of software remotely
communicating with other software, something nobody had seen before.</p>

<p>To really appreciate why it was this aspect of the ARPANET project that was
important and not the wires-across-the-country, physical connection thing that
the host maps suggest (the wires were leased phone lines anyhow and were
already there!), consider that, before the ARPANET project began in 1966, the
ARPA offices in the Pentagon had a terminal room. Inside it were three
terminals. Each connected to a different computer; one computer was at MIT, one
was at UC Berkeley, and another was in Santa Monica.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> It was convenient for
the ARPA staff that they could use these three computers even from Washington
DC. But what was inconvenient for them was that they had to buy and maintain
terminals from three different manufacturers, remember three different login
procedures, and familiarize themselves with three different computing
environments in order to use the computers. The terminals might have been right
next to each other, but they were merely extensions of the host computing
systems on the other end of the wire and operated as differently as the
computers did. Communicating with a distant computer was possible before the
ARPANET; the problem was that the heterogeneity of computing systems limited
how sophisticated the communication could be.</p>

<h2 id="come-together-right-now">Come Together, Right Now</h2>
<p>So what I’m trying to drive home here is that there is an important distinction
between statement A, “the ARPANET connected people in different locations via
computers for the first time,” and statement B, “the ARPANET connected computer
systems to each other for the first time.” That might seem like splitting
hairs, but statement A elides some illuminating history in a way that statement
B does not.</p>

<p>To begin with, the historian Joy Lisi Rankin has shown that people were
socializing in cyberspace well before the ARPANET came along. In <em>A People’s
History of Computing in the United States</em>, she describes several different
digital communities that existed across the country on time-sharing networks
prior to or apart from the ARPANET. These time-sharing networks were not,
technically speaking, computer networks, since they consisted of a single
mainframe computer running computations in a basement somewhere for many dumb
terminals, like some portly chthonic creature with tentacles sprawling across
the country. But they nevertheless enabled most of the social behavior now
connoted by the word “network” in a post-Facebook world. For example, on the
Kiewit Network, which was an extension of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System to
colleges and high schools across the Northeast, high school students
collaboratively maintained a “gossip file” that allowed them to keep track of
the exciting goings-on at other schools, “creating social connections from
Connecticut to Maine.”<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:13" class="footnote" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> Meanwhile, women at Mount Holyoke College
corresponded with men at Dartmouth over the network, perhaps to arrange dates
or keep in touch with boyfriends.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:14" class="footnote" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> This was all happening in the 1960s.
Rankin argues that by ignoring these early time-sharing networks we impoverish
our understanding of how American digital culture developed over the last 50
years, leaving room for a “Silicon Valley mythology” that credits everything
to the individual genius of a select few founding fathers.</p>

<p>As for the ARPANET itself, if we recognize that the key challenge was
connecting the computer <em>systems</em> and not just the physical computers, then
that might change what we choose to emphasize when we tell the story of the
innovations that made the ARPANET possible. The ARPANET was the first ever
packet-switched network, and lots of impressive engineering went into making
that happen. I think it’s a mistake, though, to say that the ARPANET was a
breakthrough because it was the first packet-switched network and then leave it
at that. The ARPANET was meant to make it easier for computer scientists across
the country to collaborate; that project was as much about figuring out how
different operating systems and programs written in different languages would
interface with each other than it was about figuring out how to efficiently
ferry data back and forth between Massachusetts and California. So the ARPANET
was the first packet-switched network, but it was also an amazing standards
success story—something I find especially interesting given <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html">how</a> <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/12/18/rss.html">many</a> <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html">times</a> I’ve written about failed standards on this blog.</p>

<p>Inventing the protocols for the ARPANET was an afterthought even at the time,
so naturally the job fell to a group made up largely of graduate students.
This group, later known as the Network Working Group, met for the first time at
UC Santa Barbara in August of 1968.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:15" class="footnote" rel="footnote">15</a></sup> There were 12 people present at that
first meeting, most of whom were representatives from the four universities
that were to be the first host sites on the ARPANET when the equipment was
ready.<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:16" class="footnote" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> Steve Crocker, then a graduate student at UCLA, attended; he told
me over a Zoom call that it was all young guys at that first meeting, and that Elmer Shapiro,
who chaired the meeting, was probably the oldest one there at around 38. ARPA
had not put anyone in charge of figuring out how the computers would
communicate once they were connected, but it was obvious that some coordination
was necessary. As the group continued to meet, Crocker kept expecting some
“legitimate adult” with more experience and authority to fly out from the East
Coast to take over, but that never happened. The Network Working Group had
ARPA’s tacit approval—all those meetings involved lots of long road trips, and
ARPA money covered the travel expenses—so they were it.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:17" class="footnote" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></p>

<p>The Network Working Group faced a huge challenge. Nobody had ever sat down to
connect computer systems together in a general-purpose way; that flew against
all of the assumptions that prevailed in computing in the late 1960s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The typical mainframe of the period behaved as if it were the only computer
in the universe. There was no obvious or easy way to engage two diverse
machines in even the minimal communication needed to move bits back and
forth. You could connect machines, but once connected, what would they say to
each other? In those days a computer interacted with devices that were
attached to it, like a monarch communicating with his subjects. Everything
connected to the main computer performed a specific task, and each peripheral
device was presumed to be ready at all times for a fetch-my-slippers type
command…. Computers were strictly designed for this kind of interaction;
they send instructions to subordinate card readers, terminals, and tape
units, and they initiate all dialogues. But if another device in effect
tapped the computer on the shoulder with a signal and said, “Hi, I’m a
computer too,” the receiving machine would be stumped.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:18" class="footnote" rel="footnote">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result, the Network Working Group’s progress was initially slow.<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:19" class="footnote" rel="footnote">19</a></sup> The
group did not settle on an “official” specification for any protocol until
June, 1970, nearly two years after the group’s first meeting.<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:20" class="footnote" rel="footnote">20</a></sup></p>

<p>But by the time the ARPANET was to be shown off at the 1972 ICCC, all the key
protocols were in place. A scenario like the chess scenario exercised many of
them. When a user ran the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@e r</code>, short for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@echo remote</code>, that
instructed the TIP to make use of a facility in the new TELNET virtual teletype
protocol to inform the remote host that it should echo the user’s input. When a
user then ran the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@L 134</code>, short for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@login 134</code>, that caused the TIP
to invoke the Initial Connection Protocol with host 134, which in turn would
cause the remote host to allocate all the necessary resources for the
connection and drop the user into a TELNET session. (The file transfer scenario
I described may well have made use of the File Transfer Protocol, though that
protocol was only ready shortly before the conference.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:21" class="footnote" rel="footnote">21</a></sup>) All of these
protocols were known as “level three” protocols, and below them were the
host-to-host protocol at level two (which defined the basic format for the
messages the hosts should expect from each other), and the host-to-IMP protocol
at level one (which defined how hosts communicated with the routing equipment
they were linked to). Incredibly, the protocols all worked.</p>

<p>In my view, the Network Working Group was able to get everything together in
time and just generally excel at its task because it adopted an open
and informal approach to standardization, as exemplified by the famous Request
for Comments (RFC) series of documents. These documents, originally circulated
among the members of the Network Working Group by snail mail, were a way of
keeping in touch between meetings and soliciting feedback to ideas. The
“Request for Comments” framing was suggested by Steve Crocker, who authored the
first RFC and supervised the RFC mailing list in the early years, in an attempt
to emphasize the open-ended and collaborative nature of what the group was
trying to do. That framing, and the availability of the documents themselves,
made the protocol design process into a melting pot of contributions and riffs
on other people’s contributions where the best ideas could emerge without
anyone losing face. The RFC process was a smashing success and is still used to
specify internet standards today, half a century later.</p>

<p>It’s this legacy of the Network Working Group that I think we should highlight
when we talk about ARPANET’s impact. Though today one of the most magical
things about the internet is that it can connect us with people on the other
side of the planet, it’s only slightly facetious to say that that technology
has been with us since the 19th century. Physical distance was conquered well
before the ARPANET by the telegraph. The kind of distance conquered by the
ARPANET was instead the logical distance between the operating systems,
character codes, programming languages, and organizational policies employed at
each host site. Implementing the first packet-switched network was of course a
major feat of engineering that should also be mentioned, but the problem of
agreeing on standards to connect computers that had never been designed to play
nice with each other was the harder of the two big problems involved in
building the ARPANET—and its solution was the most miraculous part of the
ARPANET story.</p>

<p>In 1981, ARPA issued a “Completion Report” reviewing the first decade
of the ARPANET’s history. In a section with the belabored title, “Technical
Aspects of the Effort Which Were Successful and Aspects of the Effort Which Did
Not Materialize as Originally Envisaged,” the authors wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Possibly the most difficult task undertaken in the development of the ARPANET
was the attempt—which proved successful—to make a number of independent host
computer systems of varying manufacture, and varying operating systems within
a single manufactured type, communicate with each other despite their diverse
characteristics.<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fn:22" class="footnote" rel="footnote">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you have it from no less a source than the federal government of the
United States.</p>

      <p>It’s actually not clear to me which room was used for the ARPANET demonstration. Lots of sources talk about a “ballroom,” but the Washington Hilton seems to consider the room with the name “Georgetown” more of a meeting room. So perhaps the demonstration was in the International Ballroom instead. But RFC 372 alludes to a booking of the “Georgetown Ballroom” for the demonstration. A floorplan of the Washington Hilton can be found <a href="https://www3.hilton.com/resources/media/hi/DCAWHHH/en_US/pdf/DCAWH.Floorplans.Apr25.pdf">here</a>. <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2021/02/07/arpanet.html/#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
