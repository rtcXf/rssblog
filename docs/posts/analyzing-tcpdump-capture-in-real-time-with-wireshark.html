      <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I’ve been doing some work in a Linux VM recently, and having to use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp">secure copy (<code>scp</code>)</a> every time just to copy a <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</a> capture to my MacOS machine to inspect it with <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> is not very fun.</p>
<pre><code>
        VM                              MACOS

tcpdump --&gt; capture
                                scp linux --&gt; /tmp/capture
                                wireshark /tmp/capture

</code></pre><p>Given that Wireshark can inspect packets flowing in real time, what if Wireshark perform the equivalent of a <code>tail -f</code> operation on a given packet file?</p>
<p>It turns out that this is possible and pretty simple.</p>
<p><em>tl;dr: <code>wireshark -k -i &lt;(tail -f -c +0 $PCAP_FILE)</code></em></p>

<h3 id="whats-behind-tail">What’s behind <code>tail</code></h3>
<p>While <code>tail</code> is pretty much just what it claims to be (a program that outputs the last part of a given fail), it has a pretty neat functionality of being able to “follow” a file (keep track of its status), and, whenever new things come (content gets appended to it), print to <code>stdout</code> these additions.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>file_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>/</span><span>tmp</span><span>/</span><span>file</span><span>.</span><span>txt</span><span>)</span>
<span>notification_fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>inotify</span><span>(</span><span>file_fd</span><span>)</span>

<span>while</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>):</span>
        <span>select</span><span>(</span><span>notification_fd</span><span>)</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>read</span><span>(</span><span>fd</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><ol>
<li><code>tail</code> initializes <code>inotify</code> to keep track of changes happening to a file (let’s say, <code>file.txt</code>;</li>
<li>then it waits for a change on the underlying file;</li>
<li>when the change occurs, <code>tail</code> then reads all that has not been read so far and then keeps track of the position where it was; then</li>
<li>when a new change occurs, does the same thing: reads everything from the old position until the end (<code>read(2)</code> keeps track of the offset under the hood - seeking is only needed at the first time, assuming that arguments like <code>-c</code> and <code>-n</code> are specified).</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re curious to see this in practice, you can either check the <a href="https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/tail.c#L1430">source code</a> or set up a simple test scenario where you can <code>strace</code> the execution of <code>tail -f</code>.</p>
<h3 id="opening-a-capture-file-with-wireshark">Opening a capture file with Wireshark</h3>
<p>Having installed <code>Wireshark</code> on my MacOS using the regular procedure (downloading the package and then performing the regular installation), <code>wireshark</code> binary should already be in your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
<p>Looking at the help (<code>wireshark --help</code>), we can see an interesting option to use (<code>-r</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">wireshark --help
Wireshark 2.6.2 <span>(</span>v2.6.2-0-g1b3cedbc<span>)</span>
Interactively dump and analyze network traffic.
...

Input file:
  -r &lt;infile&gt;   <span>set</span> the filename to <span>read</span> 
                from <span>(</span>no pipes or stdin!<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="reading-tcpdump-packet-capture-in-realtime-with-wireshark">Reading tcpdump packet capture in realtime with Wireshark</h3>
<p>While being able to read a packet capture in Wireshark is already interesting by itself, it doesn’t solve the problem stated at the beginning of the blog post.</p>
<p>Ideally, it’d be interesting if Wireshark was able to handle the result of a <code>tail -f</code> that could come to it either via <code>stdin</code> (we could pipe <code>tail -f</code> to <code>wireshark</code>), or via a <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2156">pipe</a> (we could provide the pipe to a flag).</p>
<pre><code>while new_packets:
        tcpdump ---&gt;
                /tmp/capture.pcap
                        ------&gt; 
                                wireshark
</code></pre><p>Having no success with the first option (supplying stuff via <code>stdin</code>), I went with the second (supplying a pipe to <code>-r</code>, the option that makes Wireshark read from a file):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Execute the `wireshark` binary with the result </span>
<span># of the bash process substitution as the argument </span>
<span># of `-r`.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># The process substitution creates a temporary</span>
<span># pipe that takes the output of the `tail -f`</span>
<span># process and makes it readable by `wireshark`.</span>
wireshark <span>\
</span><span></span>        -r &lt;<span>(</span>tail -f -c +0 /tmp/capture.pcap<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><figure>

<p>No success, <em>but</em>, a pretty clear direction: use <code>-i</code>.</p>
<p>Replace <code>-r</code> with <code>-i</code> and see it “not failing” (nothing starts):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">wireshark <span>\
</span><span></span>        -i &lt;<span>(</span>tail -f -c +0 /tmp/capture.pcap<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That’s because we’re missing an extra flag (<code>-k</code>): the one that tells Wireshark to start capturing the packets right away:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">wireshark <span>\
</span><span></span>        -k <span>\
</span><span></span>        -i &lt;<span>(</span>tail -f -c +0 /tmp/capture.pcap<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>It’s great how we can combine something like bash process substitution with a program like Wireshark and achieve a much better result compared to what I had before.</p>
<p>As I’ve decided to go with a MacbookPro for personal use while I still do a bunch of Linux development, having these tricks under the belt helps a lot.</p>
<p>Do you have some that you use all the time as well?</p>
<p>Please let me know!</p>
