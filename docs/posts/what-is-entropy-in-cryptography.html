        <h1>What Is Entropy In Cryptography?</h1>

           <p>If you‚Äôre familiar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a>, you may recognize the second law as the one that deals with entropy. In the realm of physics, entropy represents the degree of disorder in a system. Because systems tend to degrade over time, thermodynamic energy becomes less available to do mechanical work.</p>
<p>However, in <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/what-is-cryptography/">cryptography</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing)">entropy</a> has a slightly different meaning. It refers to the randomness collected by a system for use in algorithms that require random seeds. A lack of good entropy can leave a crypto system vulnerable and unable to encrypt data securely.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.boot.dev/">Boot.dev</a> checkout system needs to generate random coupon codes from time to time. If the coupon codes weren‚Äôt generated with enough randomness, attackers could pre-compute the codes and steal access to the courses!</p>

<p>Deterministic machines are machines that do exactly what we tell them to do.</p>
<p>Every.</p>
<p>Single.</p>
<p>Time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In mathematics, computer science, and physics, a <strong>deterministic system</strong> is a system in which no randomness is involved in the development of future states of the system. A deterministic model will thus always produce the same output from a given starting condition or initial state</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To coax a machine into doing something random, we actually have to introduce a source of seemingly random input from outside the machine. Typically operating systems are primarily responsible for supplying sources of entropy to programs.</p>

  <span> An example - How does the Linux kernel produce randomness for applications?</span> <a href="#an-example---how-does-the-linux-kernel-produce-randomness-for-applications">üîó</a></h3>
<p>A typical Linux machine can generate secure random numbers. Because Linux is conveniently open-source, I can provide you a link to <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/a24d22b225ce158651378869a6b88105c4bdb887/drivers/char/random.c">random.c</a>, a file responsible for randomness in the Linux kernel. By taking a look at the comments at the top of the file, we learn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must try to gather ‚Äúenvironmental noise‚Äù from the computer‚Äôs environment, which must be hard for outside attackers to observe, and use that to generate random numbers. In a Unix environment, this is best done from inside the kernel.</p>
<p>Sources of randomness from the environment include inter-keyboard timings, inter-interrupt timings from some interrupts, and other events which are both (a) non-deterministic and (b) hard for an outside observer to measure.</p>
<p>When a user is clicking around or typing, those timings (along with other system timings), are used as inputs to a pool of randomness, an ‚Äúentropy pool‚Äù. Since these events could happen at any time, and it would be hard to predict when they will happen in advance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>^ The entropy pool, probably ^</p>
<p>Again, from the comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When random bytes are desired, they are obtained by taking the SHA hash of the contents of the ‚Äúentropy pool‚Äù.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To sum up, random data is added to an entropy pool <strong>constantly</strong>. This randomness is based on ‚Äúhard to predict‚Äù events within the machine. When a user desires randomness, a <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hash</a> is taken of the entropy pool and the result is supplied to the user. When we call any secure randomness function on a Linux machine, we are likely using this driver or one very similar to it.</p>

  <span> How much entropy is needed for a computer?</span> <a href="#how-much-entropy-is-needed-for-a-computer">üîó</a></h2>
<p>A Linux machine that has sufficient entropy in its pool will usually contain <code>4096</code> bits of randomness. This is more than enough for several secure calculations to be performed. For perspective, a very strong private key typically contains <code>256</code> bits of entropy. If you want to see how much entropy your Linux machine currently has available, you can use the following command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
</code></pre>
