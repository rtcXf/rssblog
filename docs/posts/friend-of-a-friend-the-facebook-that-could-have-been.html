            <blockquote>
  <p><em>I express my network in a FOAF file, and that is the start of the revolution.</em>
—Tim Berners-Lee (2007)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FOAF standard, or Friend of a Friend standard, is a now largely
defunct/ignored/superseded<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html/#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> web standard dating from the early 2000s that
hints at what social networking might have looked like had Facebook not
conquered the world. Before we talk about FOAF though, I want to talk about the
New York City Subway.</p>

<p>The New York City Subway is controlled by a single entity, the Metropolitan
Transportation Agency, better known as the MTA. The MTA has a monopoly on
subway travel in New York City. There is no legal way to travel in New York
City by subway without purchasing a ticket from the MTA. The MTA has no
competitors, at least not in the “subway space.”</p>

<p>This wasn’t always true. Surprisingly, the subway system was once run by two
corporations that competed with each other. The Inter-borough Rapid Transit
Company (IRT) operated lines that ran mostly through Manhattan, while the
Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) operated lines in Brooklyn, some
of which extended into Manhattan also. In 1932, the City opened its own service
called the Independent Subway System to compete with the IRT and BMT, and so
for a while there were <em>three</em> different organizations running subway lines in
New York City.</p>

<p>One imagines that this was not an effective way to run a subway. It was not.
Constructing interchanges between the various systems was challenging because
the IRT and BMT used trains of different widths. Interchange stations also had
to have at least two different fare-collection areas since passengers switching
trains would have to pay multiple operators. The City eventually took over the
IRT and BMT in 1940, bringing the whole system together under one operator, but
some of the inefficiencies that the original division entailed are still
problems today: Trains designed to run along lines inherited from the BMT (e.g.
the A, C, or E) cannot run along lines inherited from the IRT (e.g. the 1, 2,
or 3) because the IRT tunnels are too narrow. As a result, the MTA has to
maintain two different fleets of mutually incompatible subway cars, presumably
at significant additional expense relative to other subway systems in the world
that only have to deal with a single tunnel width.</p>

<p>This legacy of the competition between the IRT and BMT suggests that subway
systems naturally tend toward monopoly. It just makes more sense for there to
be a single operator than for there to be competing operators. Average
passengers are amply compensated for the loss of choice by never having to
worry about whether they brought their IRT MetroCard today but forgot their BMT
MetroCard at home.</p>

<p>Okay, so what does the Subway have to do with social networking? Well, I have
wondered for a while now whether Facebook has, like the MTA, a natural
monopoly. Facebook does seem to have <em>a</em> monopoly, whether natural or
unnatural—not over social media per se (I spend much more time on Twitter), but
over my internet social connections with real people I know. It has a monopoly
over, as they call it, my digitized “social graph”; I would quit Facebook
tomorrow if I didn’t worry that by doing so I might lose many of those
connections. I get angry about this power that Facebook has over me. I get
angry in a way that I do not get angry about the MTA, even though the Subway
is, metaphorically and literally, a sprawling trash fire. And I suppose I get
angry because at root I believe that Facebook’s monopoly, unlike the MTA’s, is
not a natural one.</p>

<p>What this must mean is that I think Facebook owns all of our social data
now because they happened to get there first and then dig a big moat around
themselves, not because a world with competing Facebook-like platforms is
inefficient or impossible. Is that true, though? There are some good reasons to
think it isn’t: Did Facebook simply get there first, or did they instead just
do social networking better than everyone else? Isn’t the fact that there is
only one Facebook actually convenient if you are trying to figure out how to
contact an old friend? In a world of competing Facebooks, what would it mean if
you and your boyfriend are now Facebook official, but he still hasn’t gotten
around to updating his relationship status on VisageBook, which still says he
is in a relationship with his college ex? Which site will people trust? Also,
if there were multiple sites, wouldn’t everyone spend a lot more time filling
out web forms?</p>

<p>In the last few years, as the disadvantages of centralized social networks have
dramatically made themselves apparent, many people have attempted to create
decentralized alternatives. These alternatives are based on open
standards that could potentially support an ecosystem of inter-operating social
networks (see e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">the Fediverse</a>).
But none of these alternatives has yet supplanted a dominant social network.
One obvious explanation for why this hasn’t happened is the power of network
effects: With everyone already on Facebook, any one person thinking of leaving
faces a high cost for doing so. Some might say this proves that social networks
are natural monopolies and stop there; I would say that Facebook, Twitter, et
al. chose to be walled gardens, and given that people have envisioned and even
built social networks that inter-operate, the network effects that closed
platforms enjoy tell us little about the inherent nature of social networks.</p>

<p>So the real question, in my mind, is: Do platforms like Facebook continue to
dominate merely because of their network effects, or is having a single
dominant social network more efficient in the same way that having a single
operator for a subway system is more efficient?</p>

<p>Which finally brings me back to FOAF. Much of the world seems to have forgotten
about the FOAF standard, but FOAF was an attempt to build a decentralized and
open social network before anyone had even heard of Facebook. If any
decentralized social network ever had a chance of occupying the redoubt that
Facebook now occupies before Facebook got there, it was FOAF. Given that a
large fraction of humanity now has a Facebook account, and given that
relatively few people know about FOAF, should we conclude that social
networking, like subway travel, really does lend itself to centralization and
natural monopoly? Or does the FOAF project demonstrate that decentralized
social networking was a feasible alternative that never became popular for
other reasons?</p>

<h2 id="the-future-from-the-early-aughts">The Future from the Early Aughts</h2>
<p>The FOAF project, begun in 2000, set out to create a universal standard for
describing people and the relationships between them. That might strike you as
a wildly ambitious goal today, but aspirations like that were par for the
course in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The web (as people still called it
then) had just trounced closed systems like America Online and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_(online_service)">Prodigy</a>. It could
only have been natural to assume that further innovation in computing would
involve the open, standards-based approach embodied by the web.</p>

<p>Many people believed that the next big thing was for the web to evolve into
something called the Semantic Web. <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html">I have written about</a> what exactly the Semantic Web was supposed to be
and how it was supposed to work before, so I won’t go into detail here. But I
will sketch the basic vision motivating the people who worked on Semantic Web
technologies, because the FOAF standard was an application of that vision to
social networking.</p>

<p>There is an essay called <a href="https://www.ftrain.com/google_takes_all">“How Google beat Amazon and Ebay to the Semantic
Web”</a> that captures the lofty dream of
the Semantic Web well. It was written by Paul Ford in 2002. The essay imagines
a future (as imminent as 2009) in which Google, by embracing the Semantic Web,
has replaced Amazon and eBay as the dominant e-commerce platform. In this
future, you can search for something you want to purchase—perhaps a second-hand
Martin guitar—by entering <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buy:martin guitar</code> into Google. Google then shows
you all the people near your zipcode selling Martin guitars. Google knows about
these people and their guitars because Google can read RDF, a markup language
and core Semantic Web technology focused on expressing relationships.
Regular people can embed RDF on their web pages to advertise (among many other
things) the items they have to sell. Ford predicts that as the number of people
searching for and advertising products this way grows, Amazon and eBay will
lose their near-monopolies over, respectively, first-hand and second-hand
e-commerce. Nobody will want to search a single centralized database for
something to buy when they could instead search the whole web. Even Google,
Ford writes, will eventually lose its advantage, because in theory anyone could
crawl the web reading RDF and offer a search feature similar to Google’s. At
the very least, if Google wanted to make money from its Semantic Web
marketplace by charging a percentage of each transaction, that percentage would
probably by forced down over time by competitors offering a more attractive
deal.</p>

<p>Ford’s imagined future was an application of RDF, or the Resource Description
Framework, to e-commerce, but the exciting thing about RDF was that
hypothetically it could be used for anything. The RDF standard, along with a
constellation of related standards, once widely adopted, was supposed to blow
open database-backed software services on the internet the same way HTML had
blown open document publishing on the internet.</p>

<p>One arena that RDF and other Semantic Web technologies seemed poised to
takeover immediately was social networking. The FOAF project, known originally
as “RDF Web Ring” before being renamed, was the Semantic Web effort offshoot
that sought to accomplish this. FOAF was so promising in its infancy that some
people thought it would inevitably make all other social networking sites
obsolete. A 2004 Guardian article about the project introduced FOAF this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginning, way back in 1996, it was SixDegrees. Last year, it was
Friendster. Last week, it was Orkut. Next week, it could be Flickr. All these
websites, and dozens more, are designed to build networks of friends, and
they are currently at the forefront of the trendiest internet development:
social networking. But unless they can start to offer more substantial
benefits, it is hard to see them all surviving, once the Friend Of A Friend
(FOAF) standard becomes a normal part of life on the net.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html/#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article goes on to complain that the biggest problem with social networking
is that there are too many social networking sites. Something is needed that
can connect all of the different networks together. FOAF is the solution, and
it will revolutionize social networking as a result.</p>

<p>FOAF, according to the article, would tie the different networks together by
doing three key things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It would establish a machine-readable format for social data that could be
read by any social networking site, saving users from having to enter this
information over and over again</li>
  <li>It would allow “personal information management programs,” i.e. your
“Contacts” application, to generate a file in this machine-readable format
that you could feed to social networking sites</li>
  <li>It would further allow this machine-readable format to be hosted on personal
homepages and read remotely by social networking sites, meaning that you
would be able to keep your various profiles up-to-date by just pushing
changes to your own homepage</li>
</ul>

<p>It is hard to believe today, but the problem in 2004, at least for savvy
webizens and technology columnists aware of all the latest sites, was not the
lack of alternative social networks but instead the proliferation of them.
Given <em>that</em> problem—so alien to us now—one can see why it made sense to pursue
a single standard that promised to make the proliferation of networks less of a
burden.</p>

<h2 id="the-foaf-spec">The FOAF Spec</h2>
<p>According to the description currently given on the FOAF project’s website,
FOAF is “a computer language defining a dictionary of people-related terms that
can be used in structured data.” Back in 2000, in a document they wrote to
explain the project’s goals, Dan Brickley and Libby Miller, FOAF’s creators,
offered a different description that suggests more about the technology’s
ultimate purpose—they introduced FOAF as a tool that would allow computers to
read the personal information you put on your homepage the same way that other
humans do.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html/#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> FOAF would “help the web do the sorts of things that are
currently the proprietary offering of centralised services.”<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html/#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> By defining a
standard vocabulary for people and the relationships between them, FOAF would
allow you to ask the web questions such as, “Find me today’s web
recommendations made by people who work for Medical organizations,” or “Find me
recent publications by people I’ve co-authored documents with.”</p>

<p>Since FOAF is a standardized vocabulary, the most important output of the FOAF
project was the FOAF specification. The FOAF specification defines a small
collection of RDF <em>classes</em> and RDF <em>properties</em>. (I’m not going to explain RDF
here, but again see <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html">my post about the Semantic Web</a> if you want to know more.) The RDF <em>classes</em>
defined by the FOAF specification represent subjects you might want to
describe, such as people (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> class) and organizations (the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Organization</code> class). The RDF <em>properties</em> defined by the FOAF specification
represent logical statements you might make about the different subjects. A
person could have, for example, a first name (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">givenName</code> property), a last
name (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">familyName</code> property), perhaps even a personality type (the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myersBriggs</code> property), and be near another person or location (the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">based_near</code> property). The idea was that these classes and properties would be
sufficient to represent the kind of the things people say about themselves and
their friends on their personal homepage.</p>

<p>The FOAF specification gives the following as an example of a well-formed FOAF
document. This example uses XML, though an equivalent document could be written
using JSON or a number of other formats:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:about=&#34;#danbri&#34; xmlns:foaf=&#34;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&#34;&gt;
  &lt;foaf:name&gt;Dan Brickley&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
  &lt;foaf:homepage rdf:resource=&#34;http://danbri.org/&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;foaf:openid rdf:resource=&#34;http://danbri.org/&#34; /&gt;
  &lt;foaf:img rdf:resource=&#34;/images/me.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This FOAF document describes a person named “Dan Brickley” (one of the
specification’s authors) that has a homepage at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://danbri.org</code>, something
called an “open ID,” and a picture available at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/images/me.jpg</code>, presumably
relative to the base address of Brickley’s homepage. The FOAF-specific terms
are prefixed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foaf:</code>, indicating that they are part of the FOAF namespace,
while the more general RDF terms are prefixed by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rdf:</code>.</p>

<p>Just to persuade you that FOAF isn’t tied to XML, here is a similar FOAF
example from Wikipedia, expressed using a format called JSON-LD<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html/#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  &#34;@context&#34;: {
    &#34;name&#34;: &#34;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name&#34;,
    &#34;homepage&#34;: {
      &#34;@id&#34;: &#34;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage&#34;,
      &#34;@type&#34;: &#34;@id&#34;
    },
    &#34;Person&#34;: &#34;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person&#34;
  },
  &#34;@id&#34;: &#34;https://me.example.com&#34;,
  &#34;@type&#34;: &#34;Person&#34;,
  &#34;name&#34;: &#34;John Smith&#34;,
  &#34;homepage&#34;: &#34;https://www.example.com/&#34;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This FOAF document describes a person named John Smith with a homepage at
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.example.com</code>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way to get a feel for how FOAF works is to play around with
<a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic">FOAF-a-matic</a>, a web tool for
generating FOAF documents. It allows you to enter information about yourself
using a web form, then uses that information to create the FOAF document (in
XML) that represents you. FOAF-a-matic demonstrates how FOAF could have been
used to save everyone from having to enter their social information into a web
form ever again—if every social networking site could read FOAF, all you’d need
to do to sign up for a new site is point the site to the FOAF document that
FOAF-a-matic generated for you.</p>

<p>Here is a slightly more complicated FOAF example, representing me, that I
created using FOAF-a-matic:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;rdf:RDF
      xmlns:rdf=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&#34;
      xmlns:rdfs=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&#34;

  &lt;/foaf:PersonalProfileDocument&gt;
  &lt;foaf:Person rdf:ID=&#34;me&#34;&gt;
    &lt;foaf:name&gt;Sinclair Target&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
    &lt;foaf:givenname&gt;Sinclair&lt;/foaf:givenname&gt;
    &lt;foaf:family_name&gt;Target&lt;/foaf:family_name&gt;
    &lt;foaf:mbox rdf:resource=&#34;mailto:sinclairtarget@example.com&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;foaf:homepage rdf:resource=&#34;sinclairtarget.com&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;foaf:knows&gt;
      &lt;foaf:Person&gt;
        &lt;foaf:name&gt;John Smith&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
        &lt;foaf:mbox rdf:resource=&#34;mailto:johnsmith@example.com&#34;/&gt;
        &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource=&#34;www.example.com/foaf.rdf&#34;/&gt;
      &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
    &lt;/foaf:knows&gt;
  &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example has quite a lot of preamble setting up the various XML namespaces
used by the document. There is also a section containing data about the tool
that was used to generate the document, largely so that, it seems, people know
whom to email with complaints. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foaf:Person</code> element describing me tells
you my name, email address, and homepage. There is also a nested <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foaf:knows</code>
element telling you that I am friends with John Smith.</p>

<p>This example illustrates another important feature of FOAF documents: They can
link to each other. If you remember from the previous example, my friend John
Smith has a homepage at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.example.com</code>. In this example, where I list John
Smith as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foaf:person</code> with whom I have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foaf:knows</code> relationship, I also
provide a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rdfs:seeAlso</code> element that points to John Smith’s FOAF document
hosted on his homepage. Because I have provided this link, any program reading
my FOAF document could find out more about John Smith by following the link
and reading his FOAF document. In the FOAF document we have for John Smith
above, John did not provide any information about his friends (including me,
meaning, tragically, that our friendship is unidirectional). But if he had,
then the program reading my document could find out not only about me but also
about John, his friends, their friends, and so on, until the program has
crawled the whole social graph that John and I inhabit.</p>

<p>This functionality will seem familiar to anyone that has used Facebook, which
is to say that this functionality will seem familiar to you. There is no
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foaf:wall</code> property or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foaf:poke</code> property to replicate Facebook’s feature
set exactly. Obviously, there is also no slick blue user interface that
everyone can use to visualize their FOAF social network; FOAF is just a
vocabulary. But Facebook’s core feature—the feature that I have argued is key
to Facebook’s monopoly power over, at the very least, myself—is here provided
in a distributed way. FOAF allows a group of friends to represent their
real-life social graph digitally by hosting FOAF documents on their own
homepages. It allows them to do this without surrendering control of their data
to a centralized database in the sky run by a billionaire android-man who
spends much of his time apologizing before congressional committees.</p>

<h2 id="foaf-on-ice">FOAF on Ice</h2>
<p>If you visit the current FOAF project homepage, you will notice that, in the
top right corner, there is an image of the character Fry from the TV series
Futurama, stuck inside some sort of stasis chamber. This is a still from the
pilot episode of Futurama, in which Fry gets frozen in a cryogenic tank in 1999
only to awake a millennium later in 2999. Brickley, whom I messaged briefly on
Twitter, told me that he put that image there as a way communicating that the
FOAF project is currently “in stasis,” though he hopes that there will be a
future opportunity to resuscitate the project along with its early 2000s
optimism about how the web should work.</p>

<p>FOAF never revolutionized social networking the way that the 2004 Guardian
article about it expected it would. Some social networking sites decided to
support the standard: LiveJournal and MyOpera are examples.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html/#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> FOAF even
played a role in Howard Dean’s presidential campaign in 2004—a group of
bloggers and programmers got together to create a network of websites they
called “DeanSpace” to promote the campaign, and these sites used FOAF to keep
track of supporters and volunteers.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html/#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> But today FOAF is known primarily for
being one of the more widely used vocabularies of RDF, itself a niche standard
on the modern web. If FOAF is part of your experience of the web today at all,
then it is as an ancestor to the technology that powers Google’s “knowledge
panels” (the little sidebars that tell you the basics about a person or a thing
if you searched for something simple). Google uses vocabularies published by
the schema.org project—the modern heir to the Semantic Web effort—to populate
its knowledge panels.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html/#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> The schema.org vocabulary for describing people seems
to be somewhat inspired by FOAF and serves many of the same purposes.</p>

<p>So why didn’t FOAF succeed? Why do we all use Facebook now instead? Let’s
ignore that FOAF is a simple standard with nowhere near as many features as
Facebook—that’s true today, clearly, but if FOAF had enjoyed more momentum it’s
possible that applications could have been built on top of it to deliver a
Facebook-like experience. The interesting question is: Why didn’t this nascent
form of distributed social networking catch fire when Facebook was not yet
around to compete with it?</p>

<p>There probably is no single answer to that question, but if I had to pick one,
I think the biggest issue is that FOAF only makes sense on a web where
everyone has a personal website. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, it might
have been easy to assume the web would eventually look like this, especially
since so many of the web’s early adopters were, as far as I can tell, prolific
bloggers or politically engaged technologists excited to have a platform. But
the reality is that regular people don’t want to have to learn how to host a
website. FOAF allows you to control your own social information and broadcast
it to social networks instead of filling out endless web forms, which sounds
pretty great if you already have somewhere to host that information. But most
people in practice found it easier to just fill out the web form and sign up
for Facebook than to figure out how to buy a domain and host some XML.</p>

<p>What does this mean for my original question about whether or not Facebook’s
monopoly is a natural one? I think I have to concede that the FOAF example is
evidence that social networking <em>does</em> naturally lend itself to monopoly.</p>

<p>That people did not want to host their own data isn’t especially meaningful
itself—modern distributed social networks like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a> have solved that
problem by letting regular users host their profiles on nodes set up by more
savvy users. It is a sign, however, of just how much people hate complexity.
This is bad news for decentralized social networks, because they are inherently
more complex under the hood than centralized networks in a way that is often
impossible to hide from users.</p>

<p>Consider FOAF: If I were to write an application that read FOAF data from
personal websites, what would I do if Sally’s FOAF document mentions a John
Smith with a homepage at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">example.com</code>, and Sue’s FOAF document mentions a John
Smith with a homepage at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">example.net</code>? Are we talking about a single John
Smith with two websites or two entirely different John Smiths? What if the both
FOAF documents list John Smith’s email as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">johnsmith@gmail.com</code>? This issue of
identity was an acute one for FOAF. In a 2003 email, Brickley wrote that
because there does not exist and probably should not exist a “planet-wide
system for identifying people,” the approach taken by FOAF is
“pluralistic.”<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html/#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> Some properties of FOAF people, such as email addresses and
homepage addresses, are special in that their values are globally unique. So
these different properties can be used to merge (or, as Libby Miller called it,
“smoosh”) FOAF documents about people together. But none of these special
properties are privileged above the others, so it’s not obvious how to handle
our John Smith case. Do we trust the homepages and conclude we have two
different people? Or do we trust the email addresses and conclude we have a
single person? Could I really write an application capable of resolving this
conflict without involving (and inconveniencing) the user?</p>

<p>Facebook, with its single database and lack of political qualms, could create a
“planet-wide system for identifying people” and so just gave every person a
unique Facebook ID. Problem solved.</p>

<p>Complexity alone might not doom distributed social networks if people
cared about being able to own and control their data. But FOAF’s
failure to take off demonstrates that people have never valued control very
highly. As one blogger has put it, “‘Users want to own their own data’ is an
ideology, not a use case.”<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2020/01/05/foaf.html/#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> If users do not value control enough to stomach
additional complexity, and if centralized systems are more simple than
distributed ones—and if, further, centralized systems tend to be closed and
thus the successful ones enjoy powerful network effects—then social networks
are indeed natural monopolies.</p>

<p>That said, I think there is still a distinction to be drawn between the subway
system case and the social networking case. I am comfortable with the MTA’s
monopoly on subway travel because I expect subway systems to be natural
monopolies for a long time to come. If there is going to be only one operator
of the New York City Subway, then it ought to be the government, which is at
least nominally more accountable than a private company with no competitors.
But I do not expect social networks to stay natural monopolies. The Subway is
carved in granite; the digital world is writ in water. Distributed social
networks may now be more complicated than centralized networks in the same way
that carrying two MetroCards is more complicated than carrying one. In the
future, though, the web, or even the internet, could change in fundamental ways
that make distributed technology much easier to use.</p>

<p>If that happens, perhaps FOAF will be remembered as the first attempt to build
the kind of social network that humanity, after a brief experiment with
corporate mega-databases, does and always will prefer.</p>
