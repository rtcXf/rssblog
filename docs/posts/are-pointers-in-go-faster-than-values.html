        <h1>Are Pointers in Go Faster Than Values?</h1>
        <section>
            
            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
           <p>I was recently working on a lesson about pointer performance for Boot.dev‚Äôs <a href="https://www.boot.dev/learn/learn-golang">Golang course</a> when I found myself repeating some advice I‚Äôve given many times before.</p>
<p><em>Begin quote:</em></p>
<p>Occasionally, new Go developers hear ‚Äúpointers don‚Äôt pass copies‚Äù and take that to a logical extreme, concluding: ‚ÄúPointers are always faster because copying is slow. I‚Äôll always use pointers!‚Äù</p>
<p><em>No. Bad. Stop.</em></p>
<p><strong>Here are my rules of thumb:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First, worry about writing clear, correct, maintainable code.</li>
<li>If you have a performance problem, fix it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before even thinking about using pointers to optimize your code, use pointers when you need a shared reference to a value; otherwise, just use values.</p>
<p><strong>If you <em>do</em> have a performance problem, consider:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://go.dev/doc/faq#stack_or_heap">Stack vs. Heap</a></li>
<li>Copying</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, local non-pointer variables are generally faster to pass around than pointers because they‚Äôre stored on the <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php?title=Stack_memory">stack</a>, which is faster to access than the <a href="https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Heap_memory">heap</a>. Even though copying is involved, the stack is so fast that it‚Äôs no big deal.</p>
<p>Once the value becomes large enough that copying is the greater problem, it can be worth using a pointer to avoid copying. That value will probably go to the heap, so the gain from avoiding copying needs to be greater than the loss from moving to the heap.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Go programs tend to use less memory than Java and C# programs is that Go tends to allocate more on the stack.</p>

  <span> Is this advice accurate? How can we know?</span> <a href="#is-this-advice-accurate-how-can-we-know">üîó</a></h2>
<p>While my research into the Go docs, various community articles, and even consulting the all-knowing (lul) Chat GPT confirmed the validity of my advice, I wanted to see for myself.</p>
<p>So, I wrote this benchmark that you can try for yourself if you‚Äôre curious!</p>

</code></pre><p>As you can see, passing by value rather than reference (pointer) is indeed faster in this case, even though the value is being copied.</p>
<p>That said, I admit it took me about 20 minutes of trial and error to get this benchmark into the state that I wanted to make sure it was testing what I wanted to test. There were initial drafts that I <em>thought</em> were copying to the heap, but they weren‚Äôt. That in and of itself is a good lesson: the Go compiler is pretty smart and will optimize things for you. Don‚Äôt go crazy trying to use pointers or non-pointers to optimize your code until you have something tangible to benchmark and optimize!</p>
