        <h1>Put that Framework Down Before Someone Gets Hurt</h1>

           <p>There is only one question that ignites my inner rage more than “How do I get a developer job in 3 months?”? That question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/backend/dont-start-with-frameworks/">web framework</a> should I use?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not that I think frameworks are evil, scary, or even bad. I’m just bothered by the <em>assumption</em> that to build an online thing, you <em>must</em> start with a framework.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-mean-by-framework">
  <span> What do I mean by “framework”?</span> <a href="#what-do-i-mean-by-framework">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The JavaScript ecosystem has had its way with the definition of the term “web framework”. The JS community seems to excel at keeping us from having nice things.</p>
<p>I like to define the terms “library” and “framework” as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Library</strong>: Code that you import into your project.</li>
<li><strong>Framework</strong>: A structure that you import your code into.</li>
</ul>
<p>A framework provides nearly as much project lock-in as a programming language. If I choose to build my application in Next.js, it’s impossible to move to SvelteKit without a rewrite.</p>
<p>A library is hot-swappable. If I use a library for database operations, and a new one comes out that seems to do a better job, only a small part of my application needs to be updated.</p>
<p><strong>Hey Next.js devs, React is a framework.</strong> Neither Dan Abramov nor God himself can convince me that React is just a library. I understand that it can kinda be used as one, but no one does that.</p>
<p>And while we’re at it, Express.js isn’t a framework. It’s just a routing library. <em>(yes I know it says framework on the homepage, but see my previous comments about the JS ecosystem)</em></p>
<h2 id="put-that-hammer-down">
  <span> Put that hammer down</span> <a href="#put-that-hammer-down">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Story time. I was working at a company about 5 years ago where we were maintaining an ETL pipeline that processed anywhere from 100 to 1000 messages per second. There were some micro-services involved that did a bunch of different things. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translating messages from one language to another</li>
<li>Sorting the messages into categories based on keywords in the content</li>
<li>Sending alerts based on the aforementioned categories</li>
</ul>
<p>One day I was tasked with figuring out why one of our services was choking at a mere 30 messages per second. This service was responsible for taking messages from a queue and placing them into different Postgres databases depending on which customer cared about the message. In theory, it was literally this simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Message comes in</li>
<li>If the  <code>customer_id</code> on the message is in the map of <code>customer_id</code> -&gt; <code>database_url</code>, then insert the message into the database at <code>database_url</code></li>
</ol>
<p>I hopped into the project and was immediately dismayed to learn it was a Ruby project. But not <em>just</em> a Ruby project, it was a Ruby on <em>Rails</em> project.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.boot.dev/img/800/kalmpanicrails.png.webp" alt="Ruby on Rails Kalm/Panik"/></p>
<p>Look, I have no problem with Ruby on Rails. There are plenty of examples of companies that have made millions or even billions of dollars on the back of Rails projects.</p>
<p>But this isn’t a monolithic web application. This is a <em>tiny</em> service that’s supposed to quickly dump messages into a Postgres database. Why do I need an HTTP router? Why do I need an auth library? Why do I need all the other junk?</p>
<p>I need two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to concurrently pull messages from a Rabbit queue</li>
<li>A way to insert messages into a database asynchronously</li>
</ul>
<p>Go and JavaScript both have <em>super</em> easy and lightweight ways to accomplish this. I just need a few lines of code, and not much by way of dependencies. After a couple of hours poking through this Rails monstrosity (that for some reason also used Redis to track progress) I just wrote a single worker in Go, which took less than an hour, deployed the new service, tested it in production, and archived the Ruby project.</p>
<h2 id="but-could-it-have-worked-in-rails">
  <span> But could it have worked in Rails?</span> <a href="#but-could-it-have-worked-in-rails">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Yes. I’m sure that I could have just refactored that Rails project, found the hot paths, and optimized the performance bottlenecks. I mean, it’s unlikely that it was ever going to be as fast or as lightweight as a Go service, but the project was I/O bound so it could have been fine.</p>
<p>The point is that sometimes as software engineers we find a hammer that we really love. It’s such a fun hammer! It’s so ergonomic! So <em>clean</em>! And we’re so good at wielding it! So, it’s natural that we go around swinging it at every goddamn nail we see.</p>

  <span> It’s a question of defaults</span> <a href="#its-a-question-of-defaults">🔗</a></h2>
<p>At Boot.dev we use Nuxt.js for our front-end UI. It’s a great framework. But when I write a Discord Bot you won’t catch me running <code>nuxi init</code>.</p>
<p>I’m not just saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Use the right tool for the job”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, I’m saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Use the simplest tool for the job”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to add complexity as you need it to accomplish your goals. It’s much harder to remove it.</p>
