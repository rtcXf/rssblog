      <p>Hey,</p>
<p>Although many people that are accustomed to Linux are aware of the existence of <code>/proc</code> and what some files over there can do, many lack the understanding of what goes behind the scenes to power such filesystem (myself included before writing this article).</p>
<p>If you’ve been wondering about how <code>/proc</code> works under the hood, stay tuned!</p>

<h3 id="what-is-procfs">What is procfs</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt"><code>Procfs</code></a> is a special virtual filesystem that can be mounted in your directory tree, allowing processes in userspace to read kernel information conveniently - using regular file I/O operations (like <code>read(2)</code> and <code>write(2)</code>).</p>
<pre><code>           process 123: how many files do proc321
                  |          has open?

                                     there you go! 
                                        
</code></pre><p>The “virtual” comes from the fact that there’s not really a block device (like a solid-state drive - SSD) that serves the files that we can access under the place where you mount <code>procfs</code> (usually <code>/proc</code>).</p>
<p>Instead, there’s just some code implementing the filesystem interface that gets called whenever you issue reads and writes against those particular locations.</p>
<p>For instance, when a user asks for the limits that apply to a given process, the following path gets followed under the hood:</p>
<pre><code>        cat /proc/13323/limits

                
(userspace)     fd = open(&#34;/proc/13323/limits&#34;)
                n = read(fd, buf, bufsize)
                     |
---------------------|--------------
                    vfs (common interface for interacting with
                     |   any filesystem)
                     |
                     *-&gt; who&#39;s responsible for this `/proc`
                         mount?
                         procfs! let it handle the call.
                          |
                          |
(kernelspace)             *-&gt; hey procfs, take this `read` call
                              for `/proc/13323/limits` please!

                   sure! &lt;-------*
                   I&#39;ll write the response
                   to the file.

</code></pre><p>Using a tracer like <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/trace.py">bcc’s trace.py</a>, we can see the kernel stack getting the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.15.18/source/fs/proc/base.c#L573"><code>proc_pid_limit</code></a> command getting called:</p>

<p>A nice way of viewing the difference between the two is looking at how does the kernel path compare.</p>
<p>Let’s say we have a file <code>/myfile.txt</code> that lives on a disk that makes use of <a href="https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">EXT4</a> as a filesystem.</p>
<p>If we were to read this file (making that that it’s not cached), this is how it’d look like:</p>
<pre><code>        cat /myfile.txt

                
(userspace)     fd = open(&#34;/myfile.txt&#34;)
                n = read(fd, buf, bufsize)
                     |

                     |   any filesystem)

                     *-&gt; who&#39;s responsible for this `/` mount?
                         ext4! let it handle the call.
                          |
                          |
(kernelspace)             *-&gt; hey ext4, take this `read` call
                              for `/myfile.txt` please!
                                 |
                   sure! &lt;-------*
                   Oh, I know that this file exists in the disk!
                   Let me request the underlying block device driver
                   for it.
                     |
                     *---&gt; hey whoever is in charge of /dev/sda1, 
                        please hand me the contents of my file!
                                |
          Oh, this is not ------*
          in my cache; let me ask the disk for what
          is in the blocks where this file exists.
</code></pre><p>We can see that in the case of the regular file, the <code>read(2)</code> call ends up getting down to the block device driver that issues the read against a real device.</p>
<p>Using the same tracer that we used before, we can check that, differently from when <code>read</code>ing from <code>/proc</code>, at this time, the path is much longer (goes deep down to the actual <code>blk_*</code> methods that handle block devices):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Drop the caches so that the call ends up in</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Although they look very different after <code>vfs_read</code>, everything feels the same for those consuming the <code>vfs</code> interface.</p>
<p>If you’d like to refresh some concepts around Linux in general (including filesystems), I recommend reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2QWyXp9">The Linux Programming Interface</a> (chapter 12 covers <code>/proc</code> a bit, and chapter 14 is about filesystems!)</p>

<h3 id="reading-from-and-writing-to-procfs">Reading from and writing to procfs</h3>
<p>Not only being able to give you some introspection into what is the current state of a given process or the system as a while, <code>/proc</code> is also able to let you modify some of the behaviors of the system.</p>
<p>For instance, in the example above, we dropped the caches by performing a <code>write(2)</code> operation against <code>/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</code> from the userspace.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>when it comes to <code>read(2)</code> operations, it can be seen as an interface to introspect kernel data structures associated with either the whole system or a particular process; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when it comes to <code>write(2)</code>, it can be used to change some kernel parameters at runtime.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="translating-a-file-read-to-an-internal-kernel-method">Translating a file read to an internal kernel method</h3>
<p>Coming back to the interaction between user space and kernel space, you might’ve noticed in the previous sections that there was a common thing sitting between the EXT4 filesystem and procfs: the virtual filesystem (<code>vfs</code>).</p>
<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://ops.tips/blog/-/images/vfs-abstraction.svg" alt="illustration of read being directed to ext4 or procfs via vfs "/>

    
</figure>

<p>By having this layer that sits between any syscall related to a filesystem, <code>vfs</code> is able to present a consistent API while letting different implementations to provide their functionality behind the scenes. No need for user programs to know about what’s the filesystem under the hood.</p>
<p>The way that the Kernel does this translation is pretty nifty.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of how a <code>read(2)</code> from userspace gets down to a filesystem-specific implementation of a read:</p>

        get_empty_filp+0x1      <span># finds an unused file structure </span>
                                <span># and returns a pointer to it</span>

        do_syscall_64+0x73 
        entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x3d 
</code></pre></div><p>After retrieving a file object, it then starts initializing the struct, filling the fields as they need.</p>
<p>Given that at this moment the kernel has already loaded the <code>inode</code> related to this file into memory, and knowing that the <code>inode</code> holds the pointer to the implementation of the <code>file_operations</code> interface for the underlying filesystem, <code>vfs</code> is then able to set the file operations accordingly, such that whenever a further file operations come, it just follows the pointers: <code>f.file-&gt;f_op-&gt;read(...)</code></p>

<p>Now, if that file lived under an <code>xfs</code> filesystem, pretty much the same would happen, except that the inode would be loaded for <code>xfs</code>, which would have <code>xfs</code> file operations, which would then be called when reading through <code>f.file-&gt;f_op-&gt;read</code> (<code>read</code> would now be an <code>xfs</code> read).</p>
<p>In the case of <code>procfs</code>, <code>f.file-&gt;f_op-&gt;read</code> is a <code>procfs</code> read.</p>

<h3 id="getting-proc-in-your-tree">Getting <code>/proc</code> in your tree</h3>
<p>Although in most modern Linux distributions <code>procfs</code> is probably already mounted under <code>/proc</code>, it’s possible that it is not.</p>
<p>In such case, mounting it requires only the necessary privileges and executing <code>mount</code> with the right type (<code>proc</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Mount the `proc` device under `/proc`</span>
<span># with the filesystem type specified as</span>
<span># `proc`.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># note.: you could mount procfs pretty much</span>
<span>#        anywhere you want and specify any</span>
<span>#        device name.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#         .------------&gt; fs type</span>
<span>#         |    </span>
<span>#         |     .------&gt; device (dummy identifier</span>
<span>#         |    |         in this case - anything)</span>

<span>#         |    |     |</span>
mount -t proc proc /proc
</code></pre></div><p>Once the mount point is there, we can now access it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Search for the `meminfo` file in the</span>
<span># procfs mountpoint</span>
ls /proc <span>|</span> grep meminfo
meminfo

<h3 id="procfs-after-vfs">Procfs after VFS</h3>
<p>Once we got our <code>/proc</code> mountpoint set up, we can start looking at what happens once we start interacting with it.</p>
<p>After understanding the functionality of <code>vfs</code> (and how it can trigger the specific <code>read</code> of a given filesystem by following the <code>file-&gt;f_op-&gt;read</code> pointers), it’s a matter of looking at how the file operations implementation of <code>procfs</code> looks like.</p>
<p>Differently from a regular filesystem (like <code>ext4</code>), <code>procfs</code> needs to set different handlers for different files, given that each file ends up in the execution of a different method in the kernel.</p>

<p>Taking the example of reading from <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/limits</code> (from the beginning of the article) and a different file, like <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/wchan</code>, we can see how they differ:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
</span><span></span><span>-        proc_pid_limits+0x1 [kernel]
</span><span></span><span>+        proc_pid_wchan+0x1 [kernel]

        do_syscall_64+0x73 [kernel]
        entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x3d [kernel]
</code></pre></div><p>Now, what happens inside <code>proc_pid_limits</code>, or what <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/limits</code> is all about … that’s something for another article!</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>It’s very interesting how flexible VFS ends up being.</p>
<p>The way that it presents a consistent interface for applications, letting different filesystem implementions deal with adapting themselves to such interface is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Coming from a Golang background, I found pretty neat the way that the concept of an interface is applied in this Kernel code (which is all in C, as you might’ve noticed).</p>
<p>In the following articles I’ll go on with exploring some files under <code>/proc</code>, getting deep down into what are those methods doing, so, stay tuned!</p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to drop some feedback for me, feel free to reach me on Twitter! I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/cirowrc">@cirowrc</a> over there.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
