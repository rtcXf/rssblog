In this episode of Running in Production, I talk with Nick about how we built <a href="https://www.boot.dev/">boot.dev</a>, an open-source password manager that specializes in cryptocurrency. Boot.dev uses Electron and has a Serverless component that uses Golang. It’s all hosted on AWS.</p><p>If you were ever wondering how Serverless works in the context of building a native or web application, then this episode is going to be a good listen. In addition, we talk about how different AWS services all come together to make it work. We also talk about a Serverless framework called…Serverless!</p><div>
