           <p>I’m happy to announce that today we launched our new <a href="https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-sql">Learn SQL course</a>! It was a ton of fun to write, but I also had a blast building the back-end infrastructure that allows students to write and execute SQL in the browser. If you’ve been wanting to gain a solid foundation of SQL skills, this course is for you!</p>
<h2 id="whats-in-the-course">
  <span> What’s in the course?</span> <a href="#whats-in-the-course">🔗</a></h2>
<p>You’ll learn all the fundamentals of SQL in this 11-chapter course. The instructions will all in an image + text format, but the cool part is that on each assignment you’ll be writing and running real SQLite queries in your browser! No need to set up a local database environment and install a client. The 11 chapters are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is SQL?</li>
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Constraints</li>
<li>CRUD operations (how databases play a role in web apps)</li>
<li>Basic Queries</li>
<li>Structuring Data</li>
<li>Aggregations</li>
<li>Subqueries</li>
<li>Normalization</li>
<li>Joins</li>
<li>Performance</li>
</ul>
<p>This course really rounds out our entire back-end path - all the major pieces are there! Of course, we’ll still be adding to and updating the content regularly, but this SQL course was a big “missing piece”.</p>

<p>At the time of release, the first 3 chapters of the course are free. After that, you can <a href="https://www.boot.dev/pricing">become a member</a> to unlock full access for $34/mo!</p>
