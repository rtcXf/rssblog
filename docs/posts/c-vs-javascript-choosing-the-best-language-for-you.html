           <p>JavaScript (JS), once regarded as simply a ‚Äúglue language‚Äù, has gone on to become <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/">the most popular programming language</a> in the world.</p>
<p>First appearing in 1995, JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically typed, multiparadigm scripting language that also functions as an object-oriented programming language.</p>
<p>JavaScript was invented as a way to hold together and automate different components of a web page <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/javascript/html-css-javascript/">while blending seamlessly with HTML and CSS</a>. In essence, HTML added content, CSS edited the appearance, and JavaScript glued it all together and added dynamic behavior.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we also have C#, pronounced C Sharp, which isn‚Äôt <em>just</em> a programming language, but rather a part of a larger ecosystem of Windows OS, Visual Studio, and Microsoft that requires the .NET runtime to work.</p>

<p>Released five years after JavaScript, C# was created in response to Sun (now Oracle) forbidding Microsoft from changing Java, leading to Microsoft‚Äôs own safe, performance-focused language that specializes in Windows applications.</p>
<p>C# is a general-purpose, statically typed, multiparadigm programming language, mostly used for OOP. Originally only handling crude commands and task-oriented approaches, it‚Äôs now become a popular language for building projects intended for long-term use thanks to its easy maintainability.</p>
<p>How do these languages compare though? Let‚Äôs find out by analyzing which language is best for beginners, offers better salary, performance, and is best for game development, web development, and you!</p>

  <span> C# vs JavaScript: Which Is Best for Beginners?</span> <a href="#c-vs-javascript-which-is-best-for-beginners">üîó</a></h2>
<p>When choosing your first language there‚Äôs a couple of things to look for. You want a language that is easy to learn, so you can start working sooner, one that‚Äôs versatile, and one that‚Äôs in demand.</p>
<p>C#‚Äôs syntax is straightforward, offering an easy learning curve. It‚Äôs slightly complex, meaning there‚Äôs a lot of concepts to grasp, but overall, you‚Äôll start feeling confident with the language early on. C# is also statically typed and strongly typed, so there are hard set rules around coding and using the language, creating clearer boundaries for new coders. This means less chance to cause errors and fewer errors at runtime.</p>
<p>C# was built by Microsoft for Microsoft, so it‚Äôs not the most versatile language in terms of platform compatibility. C# does have Mono, which allows you to create cross-platform applications in .NET, but .NET is still primarily used by Windows systems, and you‚Äôll get the most benefit from using it for Microsoft projects.</p>
<p>That said, C# and .NET do support large-scale enterprise projects, web development, and even game development.</p>
<p>JavaScript is more of a ‚Äúgreat equalizer‚Äù among programming languages. It‚Äôs the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology">most used language by developers</a> regardless of the field they work in, so if you don‚Äôt learn it now, at some point you probably will.</p>
<p>JavaScript is easy to pick up as well. It has a much more fluid structure, being weakly, dynamically typed. However, it‚Äôs not as complex as C#. JavaScript also uses asynchronous programming with its call and response functions, as opposed to C# explicit multithreading.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a highly versatile and compatible language with the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, Node.js, and React library allowing it to be utilized in every aspect of web, mobile app, and desktop app development. It‚Äôs also <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-javascript">used by 97.6%</a> of all websites, so there is ‚Äì and always will be ‚Äì a demand for the skill.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, C# is good for beginners because it‚Äôs easy to learn, but JavaScript holds more opportunities in terms of employment and versatility.</p>
<h2 id="c-vs-javascript-salary">
  <span> C# vs JavaScript Salary</span> <a href="#c-vs-javascript-salary">üîó</a></h2>
<p>C# and JavaScript rival each other when it comes to salary, with U.S. JavaScript developers <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-what-languages-are-associated-with-the-highest-salaries-worldwide-united-states">earning $112k a year</a>, and C# developers earning 110K.</p>
<p>Salaries aside, they also rank highly in terms of personal preference. According to the same Stack Overflow survey, JavaScript ranks high above C# as the second most wanted language by developers, and C# ranks 1% more than JavaScript for most loved.</p>
<p>Overall, there‚Äôs a stronger demand for JavaScript and it earns more than its competitor, but C# seems to hold a stronger fondness amongst developers.</p>
<h2 id="c-vs-javascript-performance">
  <span> C# vs JavaScript Performance</span> <a href="#c-vs-javascript-performance">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Like all things performance-based, this is a very tricky area, as both languages offer impressive performance and excel at the applications they were designed for. Like most languages, the performance benchmarks will vary drastically by each specific use-case.</p>
<p>However, there are a few things at first glance that indicate C# performs better on average.</p>
<p>First, C# is compiled, and JavaScript is interpreted. Compiled languages are typically faster since the code is directly put into machine code for the system to read, whereas interpreted languages have an extra step in that process.</p>
<p>JavaScript can be compiled through with the JIT compiler, and both .NET and JIT optimize code at compile time, which helps boosts performance.</p>
<p>There are also two ways to look at performance, and that‚Äôs the speed of the program and the loading time of the program. These things largely depend on the size of the program though, not just the programming language.</p>
<p>If we‚Äôre focusing on their performance based on a similar element, like server-side development, then the .NET framework produces better speed, but on the flip side JavaScript‚Äôs runtime environment Node.js offers better load time.</p>
<p>All in all, each language‚Äôs performance depends on multiple factors like the tools being used, the type of project, and the size of the project.</p>
<p>However, one certain aspect is C# will offer better performance for Windows applications, because that‚Äôs C#‚Äôs core function, while JavaScript delivers peak frontend performance for the same reason.</p>
<h2 id="c-vs-javascript-for-web-development">
  <span> C# vs JavaScript for Web Development</span> <a href="#c-vs-javascript-for-web-development">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Web development is primarily broken down into two areas: frontend and backend.</p>
<p>Backend work consists of server-side coding, the aspects users don‚Äôt directly interact with but nonetheless affect the actions performed on the site. It focuses on databases, APIs, and backend logic.</p>
<p>Alternatively, frontend development, also known as client-side development, centers around what the users see. So, the design and interface of the website all take place here.</p>
<p>JavaScript was specifically created for front-end development, changing the internet forever when it introduced dynamic web pages. Needless to say, it‚Äôs the industry standard for frontend work, and since the release of V8 engine-powered Node.js, it‚Äôs become integral to backend development as well.</p>
<p>Aside from being the industry choice, JS has amazing cross-platform support, offers a unique level of interactivity as a scripting language, and helps simplify complex web applications.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also the React library that revolutionized JavaScript‚Äôs front-end development and the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) that help make JavaScript the dexterous web development language seen today.</p>
<p>Oppositely, C# does not support front-end development. C# specializes in backend development as a strong, secure language and works well for enterprise projects and Windows applications. It also offers dynamic server-side web pages and apps.</p>
<p>The kicker, however, as we know, is that C# was made by Microsoft for Microsoft, which hampers it from having the same well-rounded web development approach as JavaScript.</p>
<p>Essentially, if you‚Äôre planning on focusing on Windows backend development, then C# is a no-brainer, but JavaScript is quintessential to this field, and if you want to work in it, then there‚Äôs no avoiding JavaScript‚Äôs importance.</p>
<h2 id="c-vs-javascript-for-game-development">
  <span> C# vs JavaScript for Game Development</span> <a href="#c-vs-javascript-for-game-development">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Game development brings a fulfilling blend of programming and creativity, and C languages found a natural home in the field.</p>
<p>C# itself is a key language used by the Unity game engine, one of the <a href="https://narrasoft.com/what-is-unity-game-engine-why-should-you-choose-unity-for-game-development/">top-performing game engines,</a> and brought about some truly stunning games like Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Fall Guys, and indie classics like CupHead.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs even been used to build mobile games like the popular Temple Run.</p>
<p>.NET itself hosts many tools that refine C#‚Äôs powerful game scripting. C# also has the help of popularity behind it. C# and C++ are both industry standard languages for game development and have the support communities and companies behind them.</p>
<p>This doesn‚Äôt take away from JavaScript‚Äôs presence in the field though.</p>
<p>Because JavaScript is the basis of the internet, it makes sense it would intuitively fit into the world of 2D and 3D web browser games. Instantly recognizable games like Bejeweled, 2048, and Angry Birds all boast the help of JavaScript and HTML.</p>
<p>JavaScript is supported by game engines and libraries like Phaser, Pixi.js, HTML5, PlayCanvas, and Three.js, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Whether you plan on dabbling or working professionally in the field, both languages offer incredible opportunities to work and develop your own gaming masterpiece.</p>
<h2 id="which-is-better-the-final-verdict">
  <span> Which Is Better?: The Final Verdict</span> <a href="#which-is-better-the-final-verdict">üîó</a></h2>
<p>So, which is better, JavaScript or C#?</p>
<p>While everyone has their favorites and preferences, it‚Äôs important to figure out which one suits yours.</p>
<p>C# is a powerful, secure language that works in tandem with the larger .NET environment. Because of its affinity for large-scale projects and back-end work, it thrives in traditional work environments where enterprise applications and powerful programs are a must.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, JavaScript is a dynamic, fluid scripting language that dominates the web. Its role as a web development language means it offers plenty of opportunity in trending start-up work cultures, as well as any web-based company.</p>
<p>Regardless of which suits your preferences, both jobs bring well-paid, creative, and busy futures to those wanting to learn the language.</p>
