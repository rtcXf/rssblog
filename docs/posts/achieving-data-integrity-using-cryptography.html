        <h1>Achieving Data Integrity Using Cryptography</h1>
        <section>
            
            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
           <p>Data integrity refers to the accuracy, legitimacy, and consistency of information in a system. When a message is sent, particularly using an untrusted medium, data integrity provides us with confidence that the message wasn‚Äôt tampered with. For example, the SSL signature of <a href="https://blog.boot.dev">Boot.dev</a> provides confidence that the webpage and data coming from our servers are coming from us and not the NSA.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-potential-causes-of-illegitimate-data">
  <span> What Are the Potential Causes of Illegitimate Data?</span> <a href="#what-are-the-potential-causes-of-illegitimate-data">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Data integrity protects from a wide range of problems that involve data being mutated against the purposes of the system. Some potential problems include:</p>
<p><strong>Physical Accident</strong> - Bits of data sent over an imperfect medium can become corrupted. For example, a wireless signal could be lost temporarily, or a wire could experience a noisy electrical signal.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Accident</strong> - The software responsible for communicating the message could have bugs that unintentionally mutate a subset of messages.</p>
<p><strong>Malicious Actor</strong> - A man-in-the-middle could be altering messages to confuse correspondents or learn valuable information.</p>
<h2 id="solution---checksum">
  <span> Solution - Checksum</span> <a href="#solution---checksum">üîó</a></h2>
<p>A checksum solves all three of the potential data integrity problems listed above. A checksum is a <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">deterministic</a> value derived from the message data and can be transmitted separately. This means the checksum for a given message will always be the same.</p>
<p>The receiver of a message can generate a checksum from the message, and if the generated checksum matches the one that was sent then the message couldn‚Äôt have been tampered with.</p>
<p>It is important to note that if the medium over which the checksum was obtained is untrusted then a malicious actor <em>could</em> alter the message and the checksum. It is common good practice to sign the checksum using a digital signature. The digital signature provides proof that the sender of the checksum is who they say they are.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-checksum">
  <span> What Makes a Good Checksum?</span> <a href="#what-makes-a-good-checksum">üîó</a></h2>
<p>There are many types of checksums, but the best checksums are typically <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">cryptographic hash functions</a>. Hash functions that have the following properties make great checksums for validating data integrity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deterministic</strong> - The hash of the same message will always be the same, with no randomness</li>
<li><strong>Fast</strong> - Computing a checksum shouldn‚Äôt use unnecessary resources (A <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/key-derivation-functions/">KDF</a> is an inefficient checksum)</li>
<li><strong>Rare collisions</strong> - The likelihood of two different messages creating the same checksum should be astronomically unlikely</li>
<li><strong>Small</strong> - The result of the hash (AKA the ‚Äúdigest‚Äù) should be short - no need to waste a lot of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/how-sha-2-works-step-by-step-sha-256/">SHA-256</a> hash function is often used to create checksum digests.</p>

<p>A common use case for checksums is the verification of a download. In this example, we are going to download the Bitcoin Core node software and verify its integrity. For an updated version go <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/download">here</a> or just follow along to use version 0.19.1. I will assume you are on Mac OS, for a different OS follow the instructions on the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/download">download page</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.19.1/bitcoin-0.19.1-osx.dmg">Download the program</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.19.1/SHA256SUMS.asc">Download the checksum</a></li>
<li>Open a terminal and go to the downloads folder:</li>
</ol>
<p>Compute and print the checksum of the downloaded dmg file:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>shasum -a <span>256</span> bitcoin-0.19.1-osx.dmg
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Which should print:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>206d8d92189d22e735393abebeb7a2e7237a119dd448b4a40df8c357da1287b2 bitcoin-0.19.1-osx.dmg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then print the downloaded (expected) checksum:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat SHA256SUMS.asc <span>|</span> grep bitcoin-0.19.1-osx.dmg
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Which should match:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>206d8d92189d22e735393abebeb7a2e7237a119dd448b4a40df8c357da1287b2 bitcoin-0.19.1-osx.dmg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they match, congratulations! Your download has been verified. No man in the middle altered the program that you downloaded.</p>
<p>Again, keep in mind that to verify that the checksum you were provided wasn‚Äôt tampered with, you would need also to verify the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x135.html">GPG signature</a>.</p>
