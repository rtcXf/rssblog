        <h1>Golang Conversions - Ints To Strings And Strong Typing</h1>
        <section>
            
            <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
           <p>Go is a strongly typed language, which means at any point a developer should know exactly what <strong>type</strong> of value they are dealing with. For example, if we have a function that prints a string, we can‚Äôt just give it an integer and expect it to work. We have to cast it to a string explicitly:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>num</span> <span>:=</span> <span>5</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>numString</span> <span>:=</span> <span>strconv</span><span>.</span><span>Itoa</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>printString</span><span>(</span><span>numString</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>func</span> <span>printString</span><span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we don‚Äôt cast the value, the go compiler won‚Äôt even let us compile the program.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-typing-is-slow">
  <span> Dynamic Typing is Slow</span> <a href="#dynamic-typing-is-slow">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Developers coming from dynamically typed languages often get annoyed with Go‚Äôs strong typing. They think that the compiler should just <em>know what they mean</em> and do the type cast implicitly. Strongly typed languages won‚Äôt guess for you. They make you make the decisions.</p>
<p>There is a reason for this. Type conversions take time and resources. If the Go runtime were to dynamically type every value then programs would run a lot slower in general. If you want slow programs then go back to Python or Javascript.</p>
<h2 id="strong-typing-is-explicit">
  <span> Strong Typing Is Explicit</span> <a href="#strong-typing-is-explicit">üîó</a></h2>
<p>In addition to strong typing being faster, strong typing allows the developer to know exactly what type of value they are dealing with. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times in Python I‚Äôve had to run a program and print out what type of object something is. (Looking at you NumPy)</p>
<h2 id="strong-typing-saves-memory">
  <span> Strong Typing Saves Memory</span> <a href="#strong-typing-saves-memory">üîó</a></h2>
<p>In one of our production apps, we were storing millions of <strong>ints</strong> in memory. Being on 64-bit machines, this means that we were storing 64 bits for each integer when in reality the integer stored was never greater than 10. By swapping out <strong>ints</strong> for <strong>uint8s</strong> we saved 80% of the memory that our application was using. The guy paying our cloud bill was quite happy about that.</p>
<p>While changing int and float types can save memory, beware of these kinds of optimizations. A program can become quite hard to read if every other line is:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>toRound</span> <span>:=</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>someNumber</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>toSave</span> <span>:=</span> <span>float32</span><span>(</span><span>toRound</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The truth is that most of the standard library functions and popular packages (and hopefully the stuff you write too) uses ‚Äúdefault‚Äù sizes. For example, <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/math/#Round">math.Round</a> uses <code>float64</code>s and <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.AddDate">time.AddDate</a> uses <code>int</code>s. Unless the memory savings are significant, it‚Äôs usually best to stick with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.</p>
<h2 id="interfaces---not-duck-types">
  <span> Interfaces - Not Duck Types</span> <a href="#interfaces---not-duck-types">üîó</a></h2>
<p>Interfaces allow for a kind of <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/golang/golang-interfaces/">polymorphism in Go</a>. Their purpose is <strong>not</strong> to give developers a way to sneak dynamic typing into the language. I‚Äôve seen developers do things like:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>func</span> <span>jsonToDynamic</span><span>(</span><span>dat</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>m</span> <span>:=</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>interface</span><span>{}{}</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>json</span><span>.</span><span>Unmarshal</span><span>(</span><span>dat</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>m</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>// do something with m[&#34;hello&#34;]
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I humbly ask‚Ä¶ why? <a href="https://blog.boot.dev/golang/json-golang/">When unmarshalling JSON</a>, 99% of the time we should know the shape of the object. If we know the shape of the object, then we should unmarshal into a struct where each field‚Äôs type is declared. We will even get a nice unmarshal error if the shape is malformed.</p>
