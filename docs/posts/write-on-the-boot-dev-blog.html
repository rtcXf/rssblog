<ul>
<li>Impress future employers</li>
<li>Help you solidify what you’ve recently learned</li>
<li>Help others find answers that took you a long time to research</li>
<li>Gain traffic and domain authority for your own blogs and projects</li>
<li>Get helpful feedback on your writing skills from our editorial team</li>
