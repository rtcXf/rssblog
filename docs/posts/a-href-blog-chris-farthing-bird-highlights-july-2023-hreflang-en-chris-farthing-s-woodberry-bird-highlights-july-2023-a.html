    <div><p>July is usually a quiet month here. There is always some hope of getting an unusual bird either through post-breeding dispersal or from an early autumn migrant, but over the years good birds in July have been very few and far between. <br/>
</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <div><p>The highlight of the month was probably the visit from a family group of five <strong>common sandpipers</strong> on the 2<sup>nd</sup>. They spent most of their time here perched on the posts around the lagoons, but also investigated the tern rafts. Single birds were also seen on a couple of dates later in the month.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p><strong>Common terns (above)</strong> continued to be a daily fixture here, usually one or two birds at a time but we had the highest count of the year on the 21<sup>st</sup> when five birds were here together. The terns almost certainly visit from the local breeding colonies at Walthamstow Wetlands and Banbury Reservoir. Two other birds which don’t breed here but don’t have to travel far from their breeding sites to get here are <strong>little</strong> <strong>egret</strong> and <strong>kingfisher</strong>. The former are usually seen several times through the summer, with at least a couple of sightings here this July, but kingfishers are rarely seen here in the summer, so a bird seen on July 20<sup>th</sup> was a bit of a surprise.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Duck numbers always build up in late summer and autumn as moulting flocks form, and <strong>gadwall </strong>numbers reached over fifty in July. <strong>Shoveler (above)</strong> numbers were lower, but were close to double figures at the end of the month.</p>
<p>The <strong>great crested grebe chick (below) </strong>continued to thrive, benefitting from having no siblings competing for food, and had reached roughly adult-size by the end of July.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>The <strong>swift</strong> flock this year never reached the several hundred birds which have been seen here in previous summers, but when supplemented by the smaller numbers of <strong>house martins</strong> and <strong>sand martins</strong> occasionally seen through July reached close to one hundred birds, and the flock not surprisingly drew the attention of a <strong>hobby</strong>, which was seen on three dates through July.</p>
<p>The first <strong>willow warbler</strong> of the year generally appears either in the last few days of July or the first few days of August, and this year one arrived on cue on the last day of July.</p>
<p>The total number of bird species seen here in July 2023 was 61, fractionally below the July average for the last five years.</p>
